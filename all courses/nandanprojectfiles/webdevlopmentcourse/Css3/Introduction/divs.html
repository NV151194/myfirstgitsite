	       <p>WordPress is the leading blogging tool,
              period. It’s popular with rank beginners, mainstream bloggers, business bloggers, and pros. People use it to post their thoughts for a few friends—and to reach hundreds of thousands of people a day.</p>
              <p>WordPress is notable for several reasons. The backbone of all WordPress
blogs is free, open source software. Michel Valdrighi developed the original
software, called b2\cafelog; he’s now a contributing developer to
WordPress. The current WordPress software first appeared in 2002 as a
new version or “fork” by Mike Little and Matt Mullenweg, now the most
visible leader of the WordPress community</p>
              <p>Matt founded Automattic in 2005. Automattic is the business behind
WordPress.com, the free, hosted version of WordPress, and Akismet, the
spam blocker built for WordPress.</p>
              <p>WordPress is the jewel in the crown of the blogging world. Other blogging
tools tend to be less capable, less popular, more limited, more
expensive, or a combination of these. Only WordPress has the combination
of ease of (initial) use, power, flexibility, and low cost that have
made it the leading tool for blogging</p>
<p>There are three keys to WordPress’s power: its multiple versions, its
user community, and its status as a free or low-cost tool.</p>
