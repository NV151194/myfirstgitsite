           <div id="red"><p>Offsetting this, one of the best things about WordPress is its standardized,
easy-to-use support for creating links. WordPress cuts
out some of the options, hides the remaining complexity, and
makes creating and removing links quite easy indeed.</p></div>
<div id="blue"><p>Another reason is that blogging developed with many fairly tight-knit groups of bloggers who
visited one anothers’ blogs regularly. Links weren’t needed; it was just assumed people in a core
group had each seen what the others had posted.</p></div>
