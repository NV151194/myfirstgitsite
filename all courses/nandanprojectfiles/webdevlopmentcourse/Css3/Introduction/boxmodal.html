<h2>Using the QuickPress Tool</h2>
<p>In print, where higher resolution is the norm and where the reader has often paid for the newspaper
or magazine in question, a high-quality appearance is achieved by using the more formal full
justification. (However, you can also see large gaps between words and runs of whitespace in
newspapers, which have narrow columns and relatively low resolution—the least friendly form of
print for full justification.)
The limited width of the page available in a WordPress blog, the limited length that your blog posts
should assume, and the wide variety of ways that web pages are read are all arguments for simplicity.
Content is king; formatting is secondary and supportive. It should never be the point.
However, to say that formatting is secondary and supportive is not to say that you shouldn’t use it
at all. Many bloggers complain about the limited formatting options available to them on the Web in
general, and in WordPress in particular—and then underuse the ones that are indeed available and
handy. Try to use the formatting that is available to make your blog posts easier to scan, for readers
who are so inclined, and more interesting and rewarding when read carefully.</p>

	<p>Using ragged right for blogs and full justification for print makes sense from the respective perspectives,
if you’ll excuse the unintentional rhyme. A blog is displayed on a computer screen, and fully
justified text on a low-resolution screen tends to have gaps that are too large and clump into ugly
runs down through a block of text.</p>
