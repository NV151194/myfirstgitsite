           <p id="different">WordPress.com, a website that hosts a wild profusion of customers’ blogs. Automattic, the company
that owns the WordPress software and brand, hosts this site. WordPress.com bloggers and
their visitors only “pay” by having occasional text ads displayed on the blogs, or pay a small
annual fee to have their site be ad free. You can put a wide variety of content in your WordPress
blog, but customization is limited to setup options, scores of canned themes, and existing
widgets—sidebar tools that give additional options to site visitors.</p>
           <p class="different">WordPress software, supported by the WordPress.org website. You can download the WordPress
software yourself and install it on your own website, find a web host who allows you to install
WordPress on their site, or use a specialized WordPress hosting service in which the host sets
up and maintains the software for you. As a WordPress software user, you can borrow or buy
additional themes and plug-ins and use them on your blog, as well as create your own.</p>
           <p>WordPress MU, for multiuser. WordPress MU is the version of the software that runs
WordPress.com. You can use it to create your own hosting network, within an organization
(for an intranet or extranet), or when hosting public-facing blogs.s</p>
