           <p >Vegetable stock is both quick and easy. Vegetables and spices are resilient
and will generously give up their flavours in 30 minutes in some briskly
bubbling water. An onion, a carrot, a stick of celery and some hardy herbs
will get you far. Adding a piece of lemon skin, a smashed garlic clove and
some crushed spices will get you even farther. I have suggested a list of
ingredients that you might like to use in a quick veg stock beside each
relevant recipe.</p>
<p class="intro">Wine added to soup plays a similar role to vinegar but with less acidity
and more complexity. Use as much as you like but ideally before you
add any other liquid so the alcohol has a chance to burn off. Fortified
wines like Madeira and sherry impart a slightly sweet, nutty flavour;
Chinese rice wine does something similar. Red wine makes a soup rich,
while white wine adds zesty fruitiness.</p>
