	<h1>Microplanes</h1>
	<p>Are up there with SatNav and the mobile phone in my book. Their arrival
changed everything. Originally intended as tools for wood, microplanes are
a joy to work with and easy to clean – use them for garlic, ginger, cheese
and citrus zest.</p>

<div id="seconddiv">
	<h1>Mandolines</h1>
	<p>Are incredibly useful when the user is familiar with them, and occasionally
dangerous when not. I use them a lot, even for garlic. They give you thinly
sliced, uniform pieces of veg – necessary when you’d like everything to
cook quickly or look pretty . They can do to your fingers what they do to your veg, so be
especially cautious.</p>
