           <p id="yellow">WordPress users contribute a great deal to the software. Most WordPress support resources are created
and maintained on a voluntary basis by people sharing solutions to problems they themselves
encounter in trying to use the software. For WordPress.com users, resources offered as part of the
software, such as themes and widgets, are contributed by developers who might not be professionals
at all, just generous enthusiasts.</p>
<p id="red">Support and shared resources are most extensive for the WordPress software available from
Wordpress.org. WordPress.org is not a version of WordPress, as many people seem to think; it’s the
nonprofit community that provides the great bulk of support for WordPress software. However,
bowing to widespread usage, we refer to using the WordPress software directly as “using
WordPress.org” at some points in this book.

</p>
<p id="green">Part of the strength of WordPress comes from its status as open source software. Any user of
WordPress software can change it. Just as important, due to the strength of the WordPress community,
any user of the WordPress software can describe a change they need made—and, very often
indeed, some other WordPress user will make the change for them.</p>
<p id="opacity">The change can then get picked up and used by dozens, hundreds, or thousands of WordPress
software users. Eventually, the best changes are rolled into the WordPress core—the version of
WordPress software Automattic releases to a waiting world. Each new release is the base for
further innovations.</p>
<p id="hex">As you’ll see in this book, the WordPress resources you can get for free are tremendous. In fact, one
of the things you might end up paying for if you take your WordPress blogging further is an expert
to help you weigh the plusses and minuses of the free resources so you can choose which ones
to use!</p>
