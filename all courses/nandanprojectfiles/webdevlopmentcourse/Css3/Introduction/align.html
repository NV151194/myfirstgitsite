<p>Some form of blender is essential if you’re going to make a smooth or
even partially blended soup. Stick blenders are incredibly convenient
because you can place them directly into your pot instead of transferring
the soup into another blender or food processor and increasing your
washing-up. They’re especially useful for rough-blended and partially
blended soups. If you’re after a more refined finish then a jug blender or a
food processor is probably better suited to the job. Small personal blenders,
like the Nutri-bullet, and other high-powered brands that have recently
flooded the market, are as perfect for souping as they are for making
smoothies. Furthermore, because most of them now come with smaller
attachments, they can be used in much the same way as a pestle and mortar
– to grind nuts and make pestos and salsas. For raw soups in particular,
where ingredients haven’t been softened by heat, personal blenders are
very useful for grinding through fibrous skin, roots and hard seeds,
resulting in beautifully soft and easy to digest soups.</p>
