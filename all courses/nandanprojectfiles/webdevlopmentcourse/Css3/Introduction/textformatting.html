<p class="wrap">Blog visitors are strange about mistakes. Some are quite forgiving, taking them in a “just among
friends” spirit. Others, though, can be very harsh. Some people just assume you’re an idiot if you
make more than the most infrequent and occasional spelling or wording error. And there are some
specific mistakes, such as mixing up “its” and “it’s,” that invite universal derision.
Even a careful process of repeated checking won’t guarantee that you’ll never make a missteak.
(We did that one on purpose, we swear.) If you check several times, though, your blog will probably
have fewer errors than an awful lot of blogs out there, including some that are part of major newspaper
sites. This should help you get your message across better to all your site visitors.</p>
