                 <p>the best laptop for programming needs to have the speed and storage ideal for compilling code as well. Do not get too carried away after you find the one of the best processors. While cores, threads and clock speeds are definitely important, memory and stprage are just as vital as they can also be potential bottlenecks. The best laptops for programmmers are ones that have a processor with 4 or more cores, a minimum 8GB of RAM and of course, an SSD.</p>

                 <summary>A group of English counties has offered to host the remainder of the IPL 2021 season in September this year.</summary>
                 <p>The MCC, Surrey and Warwickshire, who are based at Lord's, The Kia Oval (both London) and Edgbaston (Birmingham), respectively are understood to be part of the group who wrote to the ECB inviting them to extend the opportunity to the BCCI. The plans would see the tournament completed in around two weeks in the second half of September.</p>
                 <p>It is further understood that Lancashire's home of Emirates Old Trafford (in Manchester) could be utilised for the tournament if the offer was accepted, though Lancashire have clarified that, although there were aware of the letter, they were not signatories. The subject is likely to come up at a virtual ICC meeting of the national chief executives scheduled for today.</p>
                 <p>The other more challenging obstacle is the existing schedule. The England-India Test series only ends in Manchester on September 14, with England then likely to tour both Bangladesh and Pakistan for white-ball matches within the following month - they are due to play the second T20I in Pakistan on October 14. Most other sides have international commitments around the same time, with potential quarantine time to be factored in - though those final weeks in September remain less busy than most.</p>

                 <summary>Coronavirus India News Live Updates:</summary>
                 <p>As many as 4,12,262 more people tested positive for Covid-19 in the last 24 hours, taking the cumulative caseload in the country to 2,10,77,410, said the Union health ministry on Thursday morning. This is the biggest spike in daily new cases India has seen so far. The country had last reported over 4 lakh new cases on Saturday. The daily fatality due to the disease is seeing an upward spike too with 3,980 more people succumbing to the disease in the last 24 hours. With this, the cumulative death toll in the country has crossed the 23 lakh mark to reach 23,01,68. Some research models recently predicted that the death toll in India could more than double from current levels.</p>
                 <p>Indian-American Congresswoman Pramila Jayapal has said the US had a "moral responsibility" to help India in its fight to defeat the raging pandemic in the country. New coronavirus cases and deaths in India hit a record daily high on Thursday after 4,12,262 new infections and 3,980 fatalities were reported, taking the total tally of COVID-19 cases to 2,10,77,410 and the death toll to 2,30,168.</p>
                 <p>The situation in India is dire. Hundreds of thousands of new COVID cases are confirmed every day, there are no hospital beds open or oxygen supply left, and people are tragically dying before they can even get to a doctor, Jayapal, the first and only Indian-American in the US House of Representatives, said. India needs our help and it is our moral responsibility to rise to the challenge at the local, Federal, and international level because to defeat a global pandemic, we need a global response, said Jayapal, who was recently in India to meet her parents who were hospitalised due to COVID-19 infections.</p>
