          <p class="positiondata">The bent candle is another sex position in the family of
kneeling sex positions. This position is known all over the
world, and very appreciated by couples. In this position, the
woman lies on the ground with her back touching the
ground and her legs up in the air, hanging straight up with
the body of her partner. On the other hand, the man is
standing on her knees with his legs folded and hands on the
knees of his female partner, holding her tightly to support
her legs and making room for his penis in her pelvis. Woman
is lying straight on the ground with face and boobs up,
enthusiasting him to kiss and fuck thoroughly. The sex
would be quite reluctant and sensational as it offers deep
penetration with straight and curvy inclusion inside the
vaginal and anal hole, allowing both partners to move fast
or slow according to their choice. The man could go gently
and slower, if he wants, to feel the sensations and satisfy his
partner by offloading her from cum. Whereas, he may go
hard to feel the heat of the moment.</p>
