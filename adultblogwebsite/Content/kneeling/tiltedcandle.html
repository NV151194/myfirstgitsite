          <p>Another enthusiastic position in the family of kneeling sex
positions is the tilted candle. This position is really similar to
the previous one, but adds a bit of variety in your sexual
intercourses. In this position, the woman lies on the ground
with her shoulders and head rested on the ground. While his
lower part is lifted above the ground by the man with his
hands beneath her buttocks. The woman places both of her
legs on the same side of the man, leaving her a bit
imbalanced. This position offers the man with a lot more
creativity to fasten his strokes as he has more room for his
penis to strike hard to reach the depths of the vagina. In this
way, he can make sex really hard for the woman and make
him immediate offloading with cum and satisfying her
completely. The best approach to enjoy this position is to
raise her pelvis up and tilt her lower body to make room for
the penis and exposure. Trying all angles of this position can
offer to explore the beauties of sex either going gentle or
harsh, relying on mutual understanding.</p>
