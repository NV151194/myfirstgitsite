          <p>tucked type differs
in female’s legs position, that is bent on the knees, lied
towards the abdomen and positioned outside of the male’s
body. This benefits man by reducing the strain of leaning
more and getting tired early. It also encourages man to get
more physical and smooth towards the woman by getting
frictionless, deeper vaginal penetration, with no barriers
across the way, as legs are farther apart. It allows both
partners to feel the thorough legitimacy of facial expression
reading, hugging tightly, kissing and licking every part of
the partner’s body, plus a strong inclusion of sex organs.
This position allows deeper penetration, with mild
experience of frictionless travel and clitoris journey, with
favorable experiences for both partners. It allows partners
to mingle their bodies with fuller instincts and an extensive
experience of kissing and praising the female body as man
is on top, lying straight and leaning forward by applying
some weight on the female’s body. This experience is quite
enthusiastic and satisfies both partners.</p>
