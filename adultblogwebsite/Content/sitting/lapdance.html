          <p>Another sitting fiesta is the famous lap dance sex position.
This is quite amazing when it comes to its peak. It offers
flexibility, fastness and rubbing together with strong clitoral
stimulation as well as exposure of female’s back to her male
partner. In this style of sex, the woman has her legs
positioned inside the men. This guarantees a bit controlled
penetration but, with a gentle push from the male, it could
go deeper inside her holes. The deeper you go, the more
enthusiastic it will be. But this position may come out herder
on legs, as the whole weight of the body is on legs, with
tilted ass and leaned on the man’s penis. It may stretch
muscles a bit too. But going smoother will solve the
question. Try using different exposures like going front to
back, side to side, back to front and much more. The best
thing is that it allows anal gaping and deep penetration in
the anal hole that is way more joyous for some males and
females too.</p>
