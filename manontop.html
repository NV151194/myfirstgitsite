                Man on top is not the dominance of man to woman, but an equitable way of pleasure for both partners. It allows them constant eye contact and easy access to kissing, licking bodies and sucking boobs. Plus, it is quite relaxing and enjoyable to put the
                man on control and lie down, being on top of her and going deep inside, spicing the experience of both partners up. It allows the man to adjust his body towards her navel so that his penis gets deeper and deeper into the vagina, proving
                a strong stimulation and a rubbing experience to the inner lips of the vagina. This could be varied by small movements, like straightening the legs and allowing him to shallow or bending knees by either of the partners. Or even by allowing
                the male to stay on feet and go straight and deep with friction into the vagina. Many variations are possible with enormous hidden joys. Variations will crave both partners to indulge deep into sex and experience unforgettable joys.
