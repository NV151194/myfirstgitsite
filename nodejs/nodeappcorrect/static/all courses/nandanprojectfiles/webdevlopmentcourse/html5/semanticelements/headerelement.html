        <h1>Warm and cool colors</h1>
        <p>Colors are either warm or cool; it’s the most basic color rule. Warm colors
are reds and yellows. Cool colors are greens and blues. Draw a line down
the middle of the wheel; warm and cool colors will be on opposite sides.
Every warm color has a cool complement.</p>
        <p>Warm colors are relaxing, friendly (sometimes even sexy), and associated
with easy-going informality and intimacy. These colors seem to advance
toward the viewer. Warm colors speed up heart rates and create
excitement. Mild warm colors stimulate; intense ones motivate — notice
that fast food places use orange to get you in and out in a hurry.</p>
        <p>Cool colors are more refreshing and emotionally distant, and they are
associated with formality and reserved behavior. They seem to recede
away from the viewer, so that walls seem farther away than they actually
are. Cool colors slow down heart rates and relieve mental tension. Mild
cool colors soothe; intense ones sedate — lots of medical facilities use
green to balance their patients’ tension.</p>
        <p>You can use warm and cool colors to fix problems. Want to cool down a
too-warm room? Use colors from the cool side of the color wheel. Want to
warm up a space that seems chilly? Use a color from the warm side of the
color wheel. Want room temperature not to be a factor? Choose a neutral
color (See Chapter 8 for some color troubleshooting tips.)</p>
