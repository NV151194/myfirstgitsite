    <h1>The Color Wheel</h1>
      <p>When you first hear of a color wheel, you may have images
     of amusement park rides. But a color wheel won’t make you
     dizzy! It starts with a rainbow bent into a circle.
     </p>
     <p>The color wheel has primary colors (red, yellow, and 
        blue) evenly spaced between secondary colors (orange,
        green, and violet). Mixing analogous (adjacent) colors 
        creates tertiary (third) and quaternary (fourth) colors
        that usually go by exotic names. Paint decks are color
        wheels with all the tints and tones to make color
        selection foolproof (see the preceding section, “Finding 
        foolproof color schemes”).
     </p>
     <p>The color wheel makes seeing color relationships easier. Colors have
relationships to each other. They are next to, across from, and at angles to
each other. Designers talk about color schemes in terms of where colors
are in these relationships.</p>

        <h1>Analogous colors</h1>
        <p>Colors next to each other are analogous (alike). (A good example of
analogous primaries is red and yellow.) Mixing these two colors creates
more analogous colors. Because they are so closely related, they always
work well together.</p>

        <h1>Complementary colors</h1>
        <p>Colors placed opposite each other are complementary. Red and green are a
good example. Every color has a complement. Don’t use equal amounts of
complementary colors in your color scheme because it produces an
unpleasant tension. Do use a larger amount of one color when using
complementary colors.</p>
