    <h1>Shapes</h1>
    <p>Disclaimer: shapes cross categories. You can have a straight-cut steak fry
or a crinkle-cut wedge for example. I’ve attempted to place each shape in
its most obvious category and have listed common names as well as
specific brands.</p>
    <article>
        <h1>Regular</h1>
        <p>The McDonald’s-style
fry (since McDonald’s deserves credit for popularizing this
width and style—and fries in general). Typically about a
quarter-inch thick. Regular- cut is the most regular cut of fries.</p>
    </article>
    <article>
        <h1>Steak</h1>
        <p>Any square-cut fry bigger than a regular-cut. About a halfinch
thick or thicker. Red Robin serves steak fries.</p>

    </article>
    <article>
        <h1>Shoestring</h1>
        <p>Any square-cut fry thinner than a regular-cut.
Popular at restaurants likely to have velvet on their walls.</p>
    </article>
    <article>
        <h1>Curly</h1>
        <p>Goldilocks fries. Often breaded, coated, and/or seasoned, like
Arby’s fries.
</p>
    </article>
    <article>
        <h1>Tornado</h1>
        <p>Typically served on a two-foot-long wooden skewer. Popular in
South Korea.</p>
    </article>
    <article>
        <h1>Waffle</h1>
        <p>Chick-fil-A–style
fries. Like curly fries, waffle fries are often breaded, coated,
and/or seasoned. CrissCut fries at Carl’s Jr. are waffle fries.</p>
    </article>
    <article>
        <h1>Wedge</h1>
        <p>Think apple
slices. Or an eighth of a sphere. Or a rounded triangular shape.
A wedge, in other words.</p>
    </article>
    <article>
        <h1>Cube</h1>
        <p>While the cube is the
most common shape in this category, most any geometric
variation that’s the size of a Ping-Pong ball or smaller fits into
this group.</p>
    </article>
    <article>
        <h1>Chip</h1>
        <p>Sliced flat and thin—with next to no vegetable on
the inside, in other words—and served hot. Typically circular
or oval, though square or rectangular certainly suffices.</p>
    </article>
    <article>
        <h1>Ribbon</h1>
        <p>The love child of the tornado fry and the chip. Look
like ribbons, really.
</p>
    </article>
    <article>
        <h1>Puff</h1>
        <p>A
difficult fry to make, and thus likely the rarest shape on this
list. It’s essentially a twice-fried, puffed-up potato chip. A
balloon chip. Crispy on the outside, hollow on the inside.</p>
    </article>
    <article>
        <h1>Skin</h1>
        <p>Slaughter a tater by cutting
it in half, scooping out the guts, and then frying the shells. It’s
basically a concave, skin-on chip.</p>
    </article>
    <article>
        <h1>Slice</h1>
        <p>Sliced flat and fat, thus leaving an appreciable amount of
vegetable on the inside. The hockey puck of fries.</p>
    </article>
    <article>
        <h1>Hash brown</h1>
        <p>Reconstituted, often shredded or mashed,
and then formed. Typically flat and rectangular.</p>
    </article>
    <article>
        <h1>Mini hash brown</h1>
        <p>Reconstituted, often shredded or mashed, and then formed.
Typically cubical, cylindrical, or spherical. Ping-Pong ball size
or smaller.</p>
    </article>
    <article>
        <h1>Miscellaneous</h1>
        <p>Any shape not
listed above.</p>
