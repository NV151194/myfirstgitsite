     <h3>Choosing a stylish color scheme</h3>
        <p>Selecting a scheme can seem like a difficult test of your decorating ability.
An easy way out is to choose a decorating style that comes with a
particular color, distinct color palette, or strongly suggested color
direction.</p>

      See Some examples include:
    </summary>
    <h4>City Chic</h4>
    <p>Think neutral colors — black, white, and beige — in
luxurious, high quality textures. Polished chrome, steel, and woods
with plenty of sheen and shine add to the glamour. Because colors
are muted in this sophisticated, tailored style, texture is supreme;
therefore, textiles have woven (not printed) patterns.</p>
<br>
    <h4>Coastal Life.</h4>
    <p>Blue and white seems so right. This Greek Islands
approach adds healthy doses of summer-sky blue to a mostly purewhite
background. Adding rustic wooden accents, textured textiles,
and glazed and decorated pottery makes this look even warmer.</p>
<br>
    <h4>Country Cottage</h4>
    <p>Ruffles and flourishes in the form of
dressmaker details (pleats, ribbon, welting, and other trim)
distinguish this feminine and pretty look. Colors run the gamut of
pastels, both warm and cool. Floral patterns abound, smaller scaled
and less imposing than the English Country House look that’s a rich
kissing cousin.</p>
<br>
    <h4>Country French.</h4>
    <p>Earthy textures and bright calico patterns found
in the fabrics make this look enduringly popular. Colors are strong:
mustard, rusty red, indigo, and grass green. Fabrics stand up well
against white plaster walls. The same patterns in wall coverings make
definite style statements for walls.</p>
<br>
    <h4>English Manor.</h4>
    <p>Floral bouquets abound in this classic Traditional
style based on English country homes. The jewel-tone colors in
brilliant reds, yellows, blues, greens, purples, and oranges are found
in the chintz floral bouquet fabric used for draperies, upholstery, and
to-the-floor tablecloths.</p>
<br>
    <h4>Lodge Look</h4>
    <p>Floral bouquets abound in this classic Traditional
style based on English country homes. The jewel-tone colors in
brilliant reds, yellows, blues, greens, purples, and oranges are found
in the chintz floral bouquet fabric used for draperies, upholstery, and
to-the-floor tablecloths.</p>
<br>
    <h4>Shabby Chic</h4>
    <p>This faded-glory style paints everything within
sight white — antiqued and softened to ivory or linen white — which
resonates strongly with lovers of genteel furnishings that appear to
have seen better days. Your paint job doesn’t have to be high quality;
the more chips, nicks, and dents the better. If your scheme seems
color-starved, add discreet accents.</p>
<br>
    <h4>Sun Country</h4>
    <p>This Contemporary Country style brings American
Country (see Chapter 9) up-to-date, using clear, light, bright, spring
and summer colors. No deep pumpkins and russets here. Look to the
flowers of spring and summer for a color palette. Simple linens and
cottons in solid colors underscore the serenity found in this countryhouse
style.</p>
    <br>
    <h4>Villa Style</h4>
    <p>Think Old World Tuscany made famous by its earthy,
well-weathered gold- and rust-colored stone or plaster walls. These
are earth tones with panache. Dark, rich, and rustic woods augment
this solid, Mother Earth look with its wrought iron accents and
beautifully woven tapestries.</p>
