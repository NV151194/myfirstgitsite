    <h1>Apples</h1>
    <p>Most apples are easy to spiralize, and you don’t need to pick out specific ones
to obtain good results. Look for apples that are even in shape and size and
have no bumps or bruises.</p>
<p>To spiralize apples, just remove the stem. You can use any of the blades
for spiralizing apples, but using a straight-noodle blade will have the apples
come out as thin slices rather than noodles. You can eat spiralized apples raw,
sauté them in a pan, or bake them in the oven. They can be prepared with the
peel on or peel off, though the peel provides you with the most fiber.
Spiralized apples are best served raw in salads, or served warm with breakfast
or desserts.</p>
<p>Apples are high in fiber, low in calories, and contain antioxidants such
as polyphenols and vitamin C, which can help boost cardiovascular health
and help fight against cancer.</p>

    <h1>Beets</h1>
    <p>When purchasing beets, make sure to buy them raw. The larger they are, the
easier they are to spiralize. Both red and golden beets work equally well.</p>
<p>Beets need to be peeled before spiralizing, and they can be eaten raw or
roasted in the oven. They go well with salads and in Mediterranean or Middle
Eastern dishes. Golden beets are a bit more mild than red beets, making them
a good pasta substitute (and less messy to prepare).</p>
<p>High in vitamin C, folate, manganese, and fiber, among other nutrients,
beets are great cancer fighters and work to detoxify our bodies and fight
inflammation.</p>
