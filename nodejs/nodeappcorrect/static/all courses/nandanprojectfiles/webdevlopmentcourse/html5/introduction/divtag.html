	  	<h1>Maca</h1>
	  	<p>It is a Peruvian root that may balance hormones. It has a fruity taste
and can be added to raw desserts, smoothies and hot drinks.</p>

	  	<h1>Medjool dates</h1>
	  	<p>They are high in fiber and a natural sweetener, which
makes them useful to add to smoothies and raw desserts instead of using
sugar or a syrup. I use fresh medjool dates in recipes because they are
large and soft, but you can use dried dates, although sometimes you may
need to soak them first</p>
