       Coconut oil has a fairly high smoke point (350Â°F), and so is suitable for
frying. It can be heated without being damaged and oxidized, as other
oils are. Oxidation causes oils to become unhealthy free radicals in the
body. Choose organic, virgin and unrefined coconut oil, which is
minimally processed. Non-virgin coconut oil may be produced from
dried coconut (copra) and will have lost nutrients as well as being highly
processed. Use coconut oil for baking, frying and in desserts or
smoothies.
