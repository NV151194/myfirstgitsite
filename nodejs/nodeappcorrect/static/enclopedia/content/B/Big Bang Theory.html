BIG BANG THEORY
The Big Bang Theory is the prevailing theory of the
origin of the universe, and it is based on astronomical
observations. According to this theory, about 15
billion years ago all the matter and energy in the visible
universe was concentrated in a small, hot, dense
region, which flew apart in a gigantic explosion.

BIG BANG THEORY
Before the twentieth century, most scientists
believed the universe was static in the sense that it
was neither growing nor shrinking as a whole,
although individual stars and planets were moving. In
1915 Albert Einstein proposed the general theory of
relativity, which is a theory of gravity that has superseded
Isaac Newton’s theory of gravity for very massive
objects. Since general relativity was invented, its
equations have been used to describe the possible
ways in which the universe might change as time
goes on. Einstein, like others before him, thought the
universe was static, but the equations of general relativity
do not allow for such a thing; according to the
equations, the universe has to grow or shrink. In
1917, in order to allow for a static universe, Einstein
changed the equations of general relativity by adding
a term called “the cosmological constant.”
AN EXPANDING UNIVERSE
In the 1920s, cosmologists examined Einstein’s original
equations without the cosmological constant and
found solutions corresponding to an expanding universe.
Among those cosmologists was the Belgian
Georges Lemaitre, who proposed that the universe
began in a hot, dense state, and has been expanding
ever since. This proposal came before there was any
substantial evidence of an expanding universe.
Nearly all stars in the visible universe are in large
clusters called galaxies. The Milky Way galaxy, the
galaxy containing the sun and about 100 billion other
stars, is one of about 50 billion galaxies that exist in
the visible universe. In 1929 the astronomer Edwin
Hubble, after making observations with a powerful
telescope, discovered that distant galaxies are moving
away from the earth and the Milky Way (and from
one another). The farther these galaxies are from the
earth, the faster they are moving, their speed being
approximately proportional to their distance.
Galaxies at the same distance from the earth appear to
be moving away from us at the same speed, no matter
in what direction in the sky the astronomers look.
These observations do not mean that the earth is at
the center of the universe; astronomers believe that if
they made observations from any part of the visible
universe that they would find the same general result.
If the galaxies are moving away from each other,
then in the past they were closer to one another than
they are now. Furthermore, it can be calculated from
the present speeds and distances of the galaxies, that
about 15 billion years in the past, all the matter and
energy in the visible universe must have been in the
same place. That is when the Big Bang happened.
Scientists do not know what the universe was like
“before” the Big Bang or even whether the concept of
earlier time makes sense. The galaxies were formed
out of the original matter and energy perhaps a billion
years or more after the Big Bang.
THE THEORY GAINS ACCEPTANCE
Fred Hoyle, an astronomer and cosmologist who had
a rival “steady state” theory of the universe, coined
the name “Big Bang” in order to make fun of the theory
in which the universe began in an explosion. The
name stuck. Today, nearly all scientists prefer the Big
Bang Theory because it can account for more
observed properties of the universe than the steady
state theory can. In particular, the observed
microwave background radiation that appears everywhere
in the sky is a remnant of the Big Bang. This
radiation cannot be accounted for in a natural way by
the steady state theory.
According to present theory, the galaxies are not
flying apart into empty space, but space itself is growing
larger. Another way of putting this is to say that
the universe itself is expanding. Although the universe
is expanding, one should not think that everything
in the universe is expanding with it. Individual
galaxies are not expanding, because their stars are
prevented from flying apart by their mutual gravitational
attractive forces. Likewise, other forces of
nature keep the stars, the sun, Earth, and objects on
Earth—down to atoms and nuclei—from expanding
along with the universe.
THE FATE OF THE UNIVERSE
What will be the ultimate fate of the universe? Will
the expansion go on forever or will gravity slow and
then reverse the expansion into a collapse? According
to general relativity, whether or not the universe will
continue to expand or eventually collapse depends on
the amount of matter and energy in the universe. If
this matter and energy together are greater than a certain
critical amount, their mutual gravitational attraction
will reverse the expansion, and the universe will
end with what astronomers call the “Big Crunch.” If
the sum of the matter and energy is below the critical
amount, then, although gravity will slow the expansion,
the universe will continue to expand forever. At
the present time, most observations seem to favor a
universe that will expand forever, but the uncertainties
are large.
Astronomical observations made in the late 1990s,
which are still preliminary, indicate that the expansion
of the universe is not slowing down, as required by
the attractive gravitational force of general relativity,
but is speeding up. One way to account for this speeding
up is to put back the cosmological constant into
the equations of general relativity. If the cosmological
constant has a certain value, general relativity allows
for the speeding up that astronomers think they are
seeing. When Einstein first learned that the universe
was expanding, he abandoned the cosmological constant,
calling it his greatest mistake. If he were alive
today, what would he think about the possibility that
his constant might be needed after all, but for an
entirely different reason? In any case, astronomers
continue to make better and better observations with
their telescopes and are hoping to obtain more definite
answers about the universe during the first
decades of the twenty-first century. However, based
on the recent history of discoveries in astronomy, it is
probable that more surprises are in store.
