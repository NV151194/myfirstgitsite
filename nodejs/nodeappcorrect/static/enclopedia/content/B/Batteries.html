BATTERIES
A battery is a series of electrochemical cells.
Electrochemical cells are devices that, whenever in
use, can continuously and directly convert chemical
energy into electrical energy.
The demand for energy from batteries is enormous.
In the United States alone, battery sales
exceeded $4.3 billion in 1997. Batteries have
become an ubiquitous aspect of modern life, providing
energy for almost every type of technology
imaginable, from small-capacity devices such as
watches, electronic toys, pocket radios, portable
computers, cardiac pacemakers, hearing aids, and
smart cards to the large-capacity applications such as
motor vehicles, satellites, remote off-grid equipment,
and uninterruptible backup power systems
for hospitals.
Because of the ever-growing demand for a wide
array of cordless electrical technology, and the
markedly increased use of electronic devices and
information technologies using integrated circuits,
battery technology advanced remarkably in the latter
half of the twentieth century. In particular, major
advances in construction technology and new materials
applications have resulted in smaller yet more
powerful batteries. It has largely been the result of
new combinations of more refined electrochemical
materials that have made batteries lighter, thinner,
and more efficient. Probably the most noteworthy
advances have been alkaline batteries for consumer
products, lithium rechargeable batteries for electronic
technology, and nickel-hydrogen batteries for use
in spacecraft.
These advances are likely to continue as industry
and government liberally invest in battery research
and development. Spending priorities of industry and
government are far different, however. Whereas the
majority of spending by industry is focused on
improving battery technology for communication
and computer technology, the majority of government-
funded research is for military, spacecraft,
transportation, and distributed energy applications.
BATTERY BASICS
All flashlight batteries, button batteries, compact
rechargeable batteries and vehicle storage batteries
operate under the same basic principles. An electrochemical
cell is constructed of two chemicals with
different electron-attracting capabilities. Called an
electrochemical couple, these two chemicals,
immersed in an electrolyte (material that carries the
flow of energy between electrodes), are connected to
each other through an external circuit.
The chemical process that produces an electrical
current from chemical energy is called an oxidationreduction
reaction. The oxidation-reduction reaction
in a battery involves the loss of electrons by one compound
(oxidation) and the gain of electrons (reduction)
by another compound. Electrons are released
from one part of the battery and the external circuit
allows the electrons to flow from that part to another
part of the battery. In any battery, current flows from
the anode to the cathode. The anode is the electrode
where positive current enters the device, which
means it releases electrons to the external circuit. The
cathode, or “positive” terminal of the battery, is
where positive current leaves the device, which
means this is where external electrons are taken from
the external circuit.
To generate electrical energy from chemical energy,
the reactant molecules must be separated into
oppositely charged ions (electrically charged atoms or
groups of atoms) and the exothermic reaction (gives
off heat) between the two reactants requires the
proper conditions and hardware to drive an electric
current through an external circuit. An electrolyte,
which can be a free liquid, a paste, or even a rigid
solid, is the ionic conductor serving as the charge
transfer medium.
The ions move between electrodes in the electrolyte
due to voltage potential gradients. The velocity
of these chemical currents increases with
temperature. Hence, electrolytic conductivity
increases as temperature goes up. This is the opposite
of electrical currents in metallic conductors, which
increase as the temperature goes down.
The external circuit provides a path for the excess
electrons at the negative electrode to move toward
the positive electrode. Although the flow of electrons
would seem to cancel out the two charges, chemical
processes in the battery build the charges up as fast as
the depletion rate. When the electrodes can no longer
pass electrons between them, the battery “dies.”
During charging, energy from electric current is
stored on the plates of the cell. Substances on these
plates are converted to new substances taking on a
higher energy. Then when the battery is connected to
any load with electrical resistance, the substances on
the battery plates begin to retransform themselves
back to the earlier state, producing electricity as a
result of the electrochemical reactions.
The quantity of electric charge is measured in
coulombs, and the unit of electric current—the number
of coulombs per second that go past any point—
is the ampere (A), named after French physicist
André Marie Ampère:
1 ampere = 1 coulomb/second
Batteries are rated by ampere-hours, which is the
total amount of charge that can be delivered. More
specifically, it is a measure of the number of electrons
that can be released at the anode and accepted at the
cathode. It is also related to the energy content or
capacity of the battery. If a battery has a capacity of 90
A-h, it can supply a current of 90 A for one hour, 30
A for three hours, or 1 A for 90 hours. The greater
the current, the shorter the period the battery can
supply it; likewise, the less the current, the longer the
period the battery can supply it.
A battery produces a potential difference between
its two electrodes that is brought about by a decrease
in potential energy as one coulomb moves from the
negative to positive electrode. Measured in volts, it is
equal to the energy difference per unit charge.
Voltage measures the “push” behind a current and is
determined by the oxidation-reduction reactions that
take place inside each cell. The better the oxidationreduction
characteristics, the higher the potential difference
and the greater the current.
There is a huge range of cell capacities. At one
extreme are miniature batteries providing milliamphours;
at the other extreme are huge submarine batteries
that can provide five million watt-hours. Battery
cell voltages for any single cells fall within in a narrow
range of one to two volts; cells are stacked in series to
get higher voltages. The connection is always negative
electrode to positive electrode so that each battery
supplies more push to the electrons flowing through
them. A typical golf cart uses three or four lead-acid
batteries in series, the 1995 General Motors Impact
electric car uses thirty-two lead-acid batteries in
series, and the largest utility battery storage system,
California Edison’s substation at Chino, California
connects hundreds of lead-acid batteries in series. In
all, this substation houses 8,000 batteries capable of
deep discharge (near-complete discharge without
hampering the battery’s capacity to be recharged),
providing 40,000 kilowatt-hours of storage.
Another important concept for batteries is resistance.
Expressed in ohms, resistance is what limits
current. For example, if a 12V car battery were connected
to a circuit with 4 ohms resistance, the current
would be 3 A. If the battery had a capacity of 90
A-h, it would supply 3 A for 30 hours. (Resistance of
4 ohms here refers to external resistance of the battery
and the headlight circuit.) The greater the resistance
of the circuit and cell itself, the less the current
for a given applied voltage.
The current from a cell is determined by the voltage
level of the cell and the resistance of the total circuit,
including that of the cell itself. If large amounts of
current are needed to flow in the circuit, a low-resistance
cell and circuit are required. The total area of the
electrodes determine the maximum current. The
amount of voltage that a battery can actually deliver is
always less than the battery’s advertised maximum
deliverable voltage. That is because once current
begins, cell voltage decreases because of the slowness
of the chemical process at the electrodes and the voltage
drop across the internal resistance of the cell.
Ohm’s law, named after German physicist Georg
Simon Ohm, explains the relationship between cureoe
rent, potential difference, and resistance in a given
metallic conductor: voltage = current × resistance
(when voltage and current are constant). In other
words, current depends on resistance and voltage
applied. By simply altering the resistance of a battery,
it can be designed for either fast current drain (low
resistance) or slow current drain (high resistance)
operation.
To ensure the safety and reliability of batteryusing
technology, the American National Standards
Institute (ANSI), the International Electrotechnical
Commission (IEC) and the International Standards
Organization (ISO) have developed standards for
battery sizes, voltages, and amperages. These standards
are now accepted on a world-wide basis.
TYPES OF BATTERIES
There are two major types of electrochemical cells:
primary batteries and secondary, or storage, batteries.
Primary battery construction allows for only one
continuous or intermittent discharge; secondary battery
construction, on the other hand, allows for
recharging as well. Since the charging process is the
reverse of the discharge process, the electrode reactions
in secondary batteries must be reversible.
Primary batteries include dry, wet, and solid electrolyte.
The term “dry cell” is actually a misnomer,
for dry cells contain a liquid electrolyte, yet the electrolyte
is sealed in such a way that no free liquid is
present. These cells are sealed to prevent damage to
persons or materials that would result from seepage
of the electrolyte or reaction products. Dry cells are
typically found in products like flashlights, radios,
and cameras. Wet cells use a free-flowing aqueous
electrolyte. Because of the large capacity and moderately
high currents of wet cells, the primary uses are
for signal systems for highway, railway and marine
applications. Solid electrolyte batteries use electrolytes
of crystalline salts. Designed for very slow
drain long-term operations, they are popular for certain
kinds of electronic devices.
Secondary batteries consist of a series of electrochemical
cells. The most popular types are the leadacid
type used for starting, lighting, and electrical
systems in motor vehicles and the small rechargeable
batteries used in laptops, camcorders, digital phones,
and portable electronic appliances.
Because of the great diversity of applications
requiring batteries, and the very distinct requirements
for those applications, there is an array of batteries
on the market in a wide variety of materials,
sizes and capacities. Some estimates put the number
of battery varieties at over 7,000. Decisions about batteries
are not simple for battery manufacturers,
designers of technology, or consumers. Many factors
must be taken into account in choosing a battery. For
any given application, important criteria may include
longer life, high voltage, fast-draining, durability,
lower weight, salvageability, recharging speed and
control, number of charge-and-discharge cycles, and
lower cost (material and construction costs).
Manufacturers often feel compelled to be very
vague about how well a battery will perform because
of the uncertainty about how the battery will be used.
Technology manufacturers invest heavily in marketing
research before deciding what type of battery to
provide with a new product. Sometimes it is a clearcut
decision; other times there is no one best choice
for all potential users. Perhaps the most important
issue is whether a product will be used continuously
or intermittently. For instance, selecting a battery for
a DVD player is much easier than a cellular phone.
The DVD player is likely to be used continuously by
the vast majority of buyers; a cellular phone will be
used very differently in a wide mix of continuous and
intermittent uses.
The life span of a battery is also dependent on the
power needs of a product. Some batteries produce a
lot of power for a relatively short time before fully
discharging, while others are designed to provide less
peak power but more sustained power for a very low
drain rate. Other important variables affecting battery
lifespan are the design and efficiency of the device
being used and the conditions of use. In particular,
exposing a battery to excessive heat can dramatically
curtail the length of a battery’s life.
Zinc-Manganese Dioxide Primary Dry Cells
Zinc-manganese dioxide cells are the most
prominent commercial battery. Over ten billion are
manufactured each year for electronic equipment,
camera flashes, flashlights, and toys. Initial voltage
for such a cell starts in the range of 1.58 to 1.7 volts,
and its useful life ends after voltage declines to
about 0.8 volt. The three types are the zinc-carbon
cell, the zinc chloride cell and the alkaline cell. The
zinc-carbon cell was invented by the French engineer
Georges Leclanché in 1866, and thus also
referred to as the Leclanché cell. Because zinc and
manganese were readily available at a low cost, the
Leclanché cell immediately became a commercial
success. It remains the least expensive general-purpose
dry cell and still enjoys worldwide use.
Figure 1 shows a cross section of a Leclanché cell
battery. The outer casing, or “cup,” is the anode (negative
electrode). It is primarily made of zinc, but also
may include small amounts of lead, cadmium, and
mercury in the alloy. Because of the environmental
hazards of mercury, manufacturers in the late twentieth
century dramatically reduced or eliminated
mercury in the zinc alloy used in disposable batteries
by developing better zinc alloys, reducing impurities
in the electrolyte, and adding corrosion inhibitors.
The moist paste electrolyte consists of ammonium
chloride, zinc chloride, and manganese dioxide.
Formed around the porous carbon cathode (positive
electrode) rod is a pasty mixture of manganese dioxide
and carbon black.
The zinc chloride cell, which was first patented in
1899, is actually an adaptation of the Leclanché cell.
The major innovation was the development of plastic
seals that permitted the replacement of ammonium
chloride in the electrolyte.
The alkaline cell appeared commercially in the
1950s. It differs from the other zinc-manganese dioxide
cells in that the electrolyte is alkaline, which primarily
reduces corrosion and allows for a much
longer battery life. Although these batteries look
quite simple, manufacturing high-performance alkaline
batteries is tedious. Many contain over twentyfive
different components and materials and require
up to forty manufacturing steps, which makes them
more expensive than standard batteries.
Alkaline cells offer the highest energy density
(more energy per given volume) of any zinc-manganese
dioxide cell, and the manufacturers continue
to improve on performance. In 1998, Duracell intro-
duced the Duracell Ultra, which they claimed will
last 50 percent longer than the standard Duracell.
And Eveready claims the Energizer Advanced
Formula of 1998 provides 100 percent better performance
than the standard Energizer of 1996.
Compact Alkaline Rechargeable Batteries
A variety of different rechargeable batteries provides
the power for camcorders, laptops, digital
phones and other portable electronic equipment. The
following are some of the most common batteries
used for these applications.
Nickel-Cadmium Cells. Nickel (hydroxide)-
cadmium, or Nicad, is the most common rechargeable
battery. These batteries are very durable and
work well in extreme temperatures. Because the
sealed cells use “jelly roll” electrodes that minimize
resistance, high current can be delivered efficiently,
which allows for quick recharging and works well for
technology requiring high current. Other advantages
of Nicad batteries are the better tolerance to overcharging
and overdischarging and the ability to withstand
700 to 750 charge-and-discharge cycles.
However, Nicad batteries have some major drawbacks.
In comparison to primary batteries and leadacid
batteries, Nicad batteries are heavier and have a
relatively low energy density. They also require special
attention from users to ensure full discharge
each cycle before recharging to prevent the capacitylowering
memory effect (hysteresis) that also shortens
battery life. When recharging a Nicad battery
that is only partially discharged, chemical compounds
around the cadmium anode are created that
interfere with recharging. If a three-hour Nicad battery
is repeatedly recharged after operating only one
hour, the memory effect will set in and the battery
will last for only one hour before it needs to be
recharged again. Sometimes the memory effect can
be erased by fully discharging the battery before
recharging. The best way to prevent the memory
effect is to closely monitor battery use and carry a
backup battery. This makes it possible to fully drain
each Nicad battery before recharging, and operate
the laptop or camcorder for extended periods.
Nickel-metal hydride is a popular alternative to
Nicad batteries since they are capable of operating 75
percent longer after each charge, are less likely to suffer
memory effects, and pose less of an environmental
disposal problem. The difference between
nickel-metal and Nicad batteries is that the negative
plate in sealed Nicad cells is replaced in the nickelmetal
battery with hydrogen absorbed in a metal
alloy. Hydrogen-absorbing alloys, which provide a
reversible hydrogen sink that can operate at ordinary
temperatures and pressures, were first used in the late
1960s in hydrogen-nickel oxide secondary cells for
communication equipment and satellites. Nickelmetal
hydride batteries are generally more expensive
and offer a more uncertain life expectancy of between
500 and 1,000 charge-and-discharge cycles.
Lithium-Ion Cells. Lithium-ion cells and the
newer alternative, lithium-ion-polymer, can usually
run much longer on a charge than comparable-size
Nicad and nickel-metal hydride batteries. “Usually”
is the key word here since it depends on the battery’s
application. If the product using the battery requires
low levels of sustained current, the lithium battery
will perform very well; however, for high-power
technology, lithium cells do not perform as well as
Nicad or nickel-metal hydride batteries.
Because of lithium’s low density and high standard
potential difference (good oxidation reduction characteristics),
cells using lithium at the anode have a
very high energy density relative to lead, nickel and
even zinc. Its high cost limits use to the more sophisticated
and expensive electronic equipment.
The lithium-ion-polymer battery, which uses a
cathode that contains lithium instead of cobalt, is
likely to eventually replace lithium-ion. Lithiumion-
polymer batteries boast a longer life expectancy
(over 500 charge-and-discharge cycles as opposed to
around 400), much more versatility (they are flat and
flexible and can be cut to fit almost any shape), and
better safety (far less likely to vent flames while
recharging).
For “smart” cards, micro-robots and small precision
instruments, thin laminated micro-cells are
being developed. Some of these developmental thinfilm
devices—using an electrolyte of lithium, a copper
cathode, and lithium again for the electrode—can
charge and discharge up to 3 volts, and can be expected
to tolerate up to 1,000 charge-and-discharge cycles.
Rechargeable Alkaline Manganese Cells.
Rechargeable alkaline manganese cells began to reach
the market in the 1990s. Compared to Nicad batteries,
these batteries are less expensive, weigh less
(because no heavy metals are used), and boast higher
energy density. The major disadvantage is its more
limited life, particularly if deeply discharged.
The major innovation that led to alkaline maneoe
ganese rechargeable batteries was the ability to prevent
discharge of manganese dioxide beyond the 1 electron
level. This has been accomplished by either limiting
discharge to 0.9 volt or by using a zinc-limited anode.
Other innovations that made alkaline rechargeables
possible were the development of a special porous
zinc anode and the development of a laminated separator
that cannot be penetrated by zinc.
Button Primary Cells
The button cells that provide the energy for
watches, electronic calculators, hearing aids, and
pacemakers are commonly alkaline systems of the silver
oxide-zinc or mercuric oxide-zinc variety. These
alkaline systems provide a very high energy density,
approximately four times greater than that of the
alkaline zinc-manganese dioxide battery.
Lithium batteries began to replace mercury-zinc
batteries in the late 1970s since lithium is the lightest
of all the metals and loses electrons easily. Before the
introduction of lithium batteries, pacemakers usually
failed within one to two years. Since the pulse generator
could not be sealed tightly enough, body fluids
leaking in caused an early short circuit, significantly
shortening the life expectancy of five years. Small and
lightweight lithium-iodine batteries, which remain
most common, dramatically cut the weight of the
pulse generator to about 1 ounce for battery and circuitry
combined. This extended the generator’s life
expectancy to almost ten years.
Lithium primary cells have also been introduced
up to the AA-size. These “voltage compatible” cells
have a working voltage of 1.5 V, and can deliver up to
four times the energy of a comparable alkaline cell.
Lead-Acid Secondary Cells
Lead-acid batteries have been a workhorse battery
for nearly a century. Over 300 million units are manufactured
each year. One of the early uses of lead-acid
batteries was for electric cars early in the twentieth
century. The development of the electric starter made
it possible for battery power to replace hand crank
power for starting automobiles in the 1920s. First-generation
portable radios with vacuum tubes and discrete
transistors, which were critical for military operations,
used very large lead acid batteries. The development of
very large-scale integrated circuits made it possible to
vastly reduce the size of these large and bulky portable
radios and use much smaller batteries, since energy
needs also were significantly reduced.
Lead-acid batteries remain popular because of their
capability to service high and low current demand,
produce high voltage, provide capacity up to 100 A-h,
and recharge well. Moreover, the lead-acid battery has
important material and construction advantages, such
as simple fabrication of lead components, the low cost
of materials (lead is abundant and much less expen-
sive than nickel or lithium), and excellent salvageability
because of lead’s low melting point.
The lead-acid battery is constructed of lead plates
or grids. The negative electrode grid is coated in lead
and other additives such as calcium lignosulfate, and
the positive electrode grid is coated in lead oxide.
Between them is the electrolyte of sulfuric acid.
During discharge, the lead dioxide at the positive
electrode combines with the electrolyte to produce
lead sulfate and water. Meanwhile, the lead at the
negative electrode combines with the sulfuric acid to
produce lead sulfate and hydrogen, which replaces
the hydrogen consumed at the positive electrode.
The reversible reaction:
Pb + PbO2+ 2 H2SO4
2 PbSO4 + 2 H20 + electrical energy
When the above reaction is read from right to left, it
reflects what happens when the cell is discharging;
read from left to right, it represents what happens
when the cell is charging.
A 12-V storage battery, the type in automobiles,
consists of six 2-V cells connected in series. Although
the theoretical potential of a standard lead-acid cell is
1.92 volts, the actual potential can be raised to 2 V by
properly adjusting the concentrations of the reactants.
These batteries provide high current, and are
designed to tolerate thousands of shallow-depth discharges
over a period of several years. Traditionally,
for automobiles and trucks, three or six cells have
been connected in series to make a 6- or 12-volt battery,
respectively. Manufacturers are likely to begin
equipping automobiles and trucks with higher voltage
batteries to accommodate increased electricity
requirements and to improve the efficiency of air
conditioning systems.
Unlike the automobile-type battery that is quite
portable, the stationary lead-acid batteries that provide
uninterruptible power to hospitals and other
important facilities are not. Some may weigh over
several tons because of the much heavier grid structure
and other features to extend life expectancy and
improve deep discharge capabilities.
Weight is usually inconsequential for stationary
applications but of foremost concern for electric vehicles.
Vehicle weight is detrimental in transportation
because the greater the vehicle weight, the greater the
energy consumed overcoming resistance. In fact,
reductions in vehicle weight was one of the major reasons
for the doubling of the fuel efficiency for the
U.S. vehicle fleet from 1973 to 1993. Electric vehicles
also present other concerns for battery makers such as
charge time and vehicle range on a single charge.
ADVANCED BATTERIES FOR
ELECTRIC VEHICLES
To hasten development of batteries for electric vehicles,
Chrysler, Ford, and General Motors formed the
U.S. Advanced Battery Consortium (USABC). In
1991 USABC, battery manufacturers, the Electric
Power Research Institute (EPRI), and the U.S.
Department of Energy (DOE) launched a joint
research effort to identify, develop and license promising
battery technology for electric vehicles—vehicles
with the range, performance and similar costs of
gasoline-powered vehicles.
Whatever the battery construction and mix of
materials being considered, the technical challenges
facing developers are
1. Improve electrolyte material, using better conductors
that are still chemically compatible with
the electrodes.
2. Reduce the amount of change in the electrolyte
and electrodes per charge-and-discharge cycle
to extend life expectancy.
3. Improve the interface of the electrodes with the
electrolyte by enlarging the effective surface
area of the electrodes.
4. Identify electrode and electrolyte material that is
inexpensive and readily available in order to
achieve a low-cost battery.
5. Improve the energy density in terms of unit
mass, unit volume, or both.
Advanced lead-acid batteries have resulted in higher
energy density, longer life expectancy, and weight
reductions. Energy density has improved by making
use of the “starved” electrolyte concept in which a
fiberglass and polyethylene separator immobilizes the
electrolyte, allowing for the passage of oxygen from
the anode to the cathode where it recombines with
hydrogen to form water. Besides improving energy
density, this concept also eliminated the need to add
water and vent hydrogen. Weight reduction has been
achieved by replacing the electrode grids of lead-antimony
and lead-arsenic with lead-cadmium. Lead-
cadmium also has extend the life expectancy.
To further reduce weight and improve energy
density, several companies are developing thin lead
film electrodes in a spiral-wound construction with
glass fiber separators. Already on the market for cordless
electric tools, this battery technology may eventually
be used in electric vehicles.
However, since the chemical reactions for leadacid
batteries cannot sustain high current or voltage
continuously during charge, fast charging remains a
major problem. Charging has to be deliberate
because the lead grids heat up quickly and cool slowly.
When excessive heating or “gassing” (liquids
inside the battery becoming a gas) occurs during
charging, hydrogen is released from the battery’s vent
cap, which reduces battery performance and life.
Other Advanced Batteries
Despite the many virtues of lead-acid batteries,
there are major limitations: range, long recharge
times, and more frequent replacement than most
potential electric vehicle buyers are likely to accept.
Much research is taking place to develop alternatives
that store more energy per given volume and mass,
cost less to manufacture and operate, weigh less, and
last longer. Some of the most promising materials
include sodium-sulfur, zinc-bromine, nickel, and
lithium.
Sodium-Sulfur Batteries. The sodium-sulfur battery
consists of molten sodium at the anode, molten
sulfur at the cathode, and a solid electrolyte of a material
that allows for the passage of sodium only. For the
solid electrolyte to be sufficiently conductive and to
keep the sodium and sulfur in a liquid state, sodiumsulfur
cells must operate at 300°C to 350°C (570°F to
660°F). There has been great interest in this technology
because sodium and sulfur are widely available and
inexpensive, and each cell can deliver up to 2.3 volts.
Though sodium-sulfur batteries have been under
development for many years, major problems still
exists with material stability. It is likely that the first
commercial uses of this battery will not be for electric
vehicles. Sodium-sulfur storage batteries may be
more well-suited for hybrid electric vehicles or as
part of a distributed energy resources system to provide
power in remote areas or to help meet municipal
peak power requirements.
Zinc-Bromide. Unlike sodium-sulfur batteries,
zinc-bromide batteries operate at ordinary temperatures.
Although they use low-cost, readily available
components, these batteries are much more complex
than lead-acid and sodium-sulfur batteries
because they include pumps and reservoirs to store
and circulate the zinc-bromide electrolyte within
the cell.
Nickel-Hydrogen, Nickel-Iron, and Nickel-Metal
Hydride. First developed for communication
satellites in the early 1970s, nickel-hydrogen batteries
are durable, require low maintenance, and have a
long life expectancy. The major disadvantage is the
high initial cost. For these batteries to be a viable
option for electric vehicles, mass production techniques
will have to be developed to reduce the cost.
A more appropriate battery for transportation
applications is probably a nickel-iron or nickel-metal
hydride battery. These batteries are not as susceptible
to heat and gassing as lead-acid batteries, so they can
better withstand high current or high voltage charges
that can dramatically shorten charging time.
In the mid-1990s, Chrysler and EPRI developed
engineering prototypes of an electric minivan called
the TEVan using a nickel-iron battery. Compared to
a lead-acid battery, this battery was lighter, stored
more energy, and lasted twice as long, resulting in a
vehicle range of about 60 to 100 miles and a top
speed of 65 mph. However, nickel-iron are much
more expensive than lead-acid batteries and about
half as energy efficient due to higher internal resistance.
(This is not just the battery, but the batterycharger-
vehicle combination according to Model
Year 1999 EPA Fuel Economy Guide for vehicles
offering both battery types.) In warmer climates,
nickel-metal hydride energy efficiency drops even
farther since there is a need to expend battery capacity
cooling the battery.
In the late 1990s, Toyota began leasing the RAV4-
EV sports utility vehicle using twenty-four nickel
metal hydride batteries. Rated at 288 volts, these
vehicles achieved a top speed of 78 mph, and a combined
city/highway driving range of around 125
miles. The electric RAV4 weighed over 500 pounds
more than the internal combustion engine version
because the batteries weighed over 900 pounds.
Nickel-metal hydride batteries are also proving to be
the technology of choice for hybrid vehicles such as
the Honda Insight because high current and voltage
can be delivered very quickly and efficiently for the
initial drive-away and during acceleration.
Lithium-Ion and Lithium Polymer. Major
research efforts are taking place in the United
States, Japan, and Europe to develop lithium-ion
technology for potential use in electric vehicles.
Sony Corporation, which was the first electronics
manufacturer to offer lithium batteries for top-end
video cameras, teamed up with Nissan in the late
1990s to develop the lithium-ion batteries for the
Altra electric vehicle. Lithium-ion batteries in electric
vehicles offer a higher power-to-weight ratio for
acceleration and a much better energy-to-weight
ratio for extending range. Nissan claims these batteries
have an energy density three times that of
conventional lead-acid batteries. The Altra can
attain a top speed of 75 mph and a between-charges
range of 120 miles in combined city and highway
driving. In the future, it is likely that the conventional
non-liquid electrolyte will be replaced with
polymer electrolytes to permit the fabrication of
solid-state cells.
