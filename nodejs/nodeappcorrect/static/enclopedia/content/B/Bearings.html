BEARINGS
A world without bearings would look far different.
Although rarely noticed, bearings are ubiquitous:
computers have a few, electric appliances contain
several, and an automobile has hundreds. Without
bearings, much of the motion that is taken for granted
would not be possible.

BEARINGS
Since the first wheel was invented, people understood
that it takes less effort to move an object on
rollers than to simply slide it over a surface. People
later discovered that lubrication also reduces the
effort to side objects. Bearings combine these two
basic findings to provide rolling motion necessary for
things as simple as a tiny in-line skate wheel and as
complex and large as a steam turbine. Bearings save
energy, which is otherwise required to counteract
friction arising from any elements related rotation,
the better the bearing, the greater the energy savings.
TYPES OF BEARINGS
Bearings can be divided into rolling element bearings
and sleeve (or plain) bearings. Sleeve (or plain) bearings
consist of many sizes, shapes, and types, each of
which functions essentially as a band (or sleeve) of
close fitting material that encloses and supports a
moving member. The sleeve is usually stationary and
is called the bearing. The moving member is generally
called the journal. Rolling element bearings are
generally constructed with one or two rows of steel
balls or rollers positioned between inner and outer
rings. A retainer is used to equally space these rolling
elements. Grooves, or raceways, are cut into the
inner and outer rings to guide the rolling elements.
Rolling bearings have a lot of advantages compared
with the sleeve bearings. Just to name a few: lower
energy consumption, lower starting moment, lower
friction at all speeds, and higher reliability. This is
why there is a larger variety of rolling bearings than
sleeve bearings. The variety of applications calls for
the multitude of the rolling bearing types and designs.
There are simple applications such as bicycles, in-line
skates and electric motors. There are also complex
applications such as aircraft gas turbines, rolling mills,
dental drill assemblies, gyroscopes and power transmission
products. Better automobile transmissions,
containing hundred of bearings and delivering more
mechanical energy to the wheels, have resulted in dramatic
improvement in fuel economy and performance
from 1975 to 2000. In delivering more
mechanical energy to the wheels, and much of that
improvement can be attributed to better bearings.
Rolling bearings can be further classified into ball
and roller bearings. The following are some of the
very common types of rolling bearings.
Deep Groove Ball Bearings
Deep groove ball bearings, widely found in automobile
applications, are the most popular of all
rolling bearings. They are available in single and double
row designs. The single row bearings are also
available in a sealed version. They are simple in construction
as well as easy to operate and maintain.
They can run at high speeds and can support both
radial and thrust loads imposed by rotating shaft and
other moving objects. They are versatile, quiet, lubricated-
for-life, and maintenance-free. The bearing
cost/performance ratio for deep groove ball bearings
is excellent. They are widely found in automobile
applications.
Self-Aligning Ball Bearings
Commonly found in vertical pumps, self-aligning
ball bearings have two rows of balls with a common
spherical outer ring raceway. This feature gives the
bearings their self-aligning property, permitting
angular misalignment of the shaft with respect to the
housing. Self-aligning ball bearings show very low
vibration and noise level owing to the high accuracy
of form and smoothness of the raceways.
Angular Contact Ball Bearings
Angular contact ball bearings are available in single
and double row designs as well as four-point contact
ball bearings. They are designed for a combined load
and provide stiff bearing arrangements. Angular contact
ball bearings have raceways in the inner and
outer rings, which are displaced with respect to each
other in the direction of the bearing axis. This means
that they are particularly suitable for the accommodation
of combined loads (i.e., simultaneously acting
radial and thrust loads such as for orbital sanders).
The benefits are high-load carrying capacity and
speed capability, low operating temperatures, long
relubrication intervals and quiet operation.
Thrust Ball Bearings
Thrust ball bearings are manufactured in single
direction and double direction designs. They are
only able to accept thrust loads but can be operated
at relatively high speeds. Mounting is simple
because the various bearing components (shaft
washer, housing washer, ball and cage thrust assembly)
can be installed separately. The benefits of
using thrust ball bearings derive from their high
running accuracy and high load carrying capacity,
which is why they are used in automobile clutches
and speed reducers.
Cylindrical Roller Bearings
Cylindrical roller bearings, found in tractor and
machine tools, can carry heavy radial loads at high
speeds because the rollers and raceway are in linear
contact. Single row bearings have optimized internal
geometry that increases their radial and thrust load
carrying capacity, reduces their sensitivity to misalignment,
and facilitates their lubrication. Full complement
bearings incorporate the maximum number
of rollers and have no cage, and are intended for very
heavy loads and moderate speeds.
Needle Roller Bearings
Needle roller bearings can support heavy radial
load such as clutches. A wide variety of designs,
including bearings for combined radial and thrust
loads, provide simple, compact and economic bearing
arrangements. Their small sectional height
makes them suitable for limited radial space of the
housing.
Spherical Roller Bearings
Spherical roller bearings are robust, self-aligning
bearings that are insensitive to angular misalignment.
They offer high reliability and long life even under
difficult operating conditions. They are mounted on
an adapter assembly or withdrawal sleeve and housed
in plummer blocks. They are also available with seals
for maintenance-free operation.
Tapered Roller Bearings
Tapered roller bearings are designed for heavy
combined loads or impact loading such as freight
train locomotives and rail cars. Composed of a cup, a
cone and a number of rollers, tapered roller bearings
can do a much better job of withstanding sideward
forces. These three components have tapered surfaces
whose apexes converge at a common point on
the bearing axis. Their excellent load carrying capacity/
cross section ratios provide an economic bearing
arrangement.
APPLICATIONS
High-carbon chrome bearing steel specified in SAE
52100 is used as a general material in bearing rings
and rolling elements. The cages can be made of various
materials, such as steel sheet, steel, copper alloy
and synthetic resins. Once relegated to high-end
applications, such as aircraft wing-flap actuators and
precision instruments, hybrid bearings with ceramic
balls are moving into the mainstream. Hybrid
ceramic bearings offer many new options for
demanding applications. Benefits include high
speed, corrosion resistance, durability, reduced
vibration, ability to operate with less lubricant, and
electrical insulation.
Today’s in-line skate market takes the advantage of
the newly available technology in bearing design. For
example, the ABEC (Annular Bearing Engineers’
Committee) scale classifies different accuracy and
tolerance ranges for bearings. A good in-line skate
bearing typically adopts a high ABEC rating bearing,
chromium steel for rings and balls, 100 percent synthetic
speed oil for skate lube, ultrafast self-lubricating
synthetic resin retainers, and unique and
attractive packaging.
