BIOFUELS
Biofuels are biomass (organic matter) or biomass
products used for energy production. Energy created
from the use of biofuels is often termed bioenergy.
Biomass crops grown for the primary purpose of
use in biofuels are called energy crops. Biofuels
include wood and wood wastes, domestic wastes,
agricultural crops and wastes, animal wastes, peat,
and aquatic plants. Almost any type of combustible
organic matter can potentially be used as an energy
source.
Plants store solar energy by photosynthesis.
During photosynthesis, carbon dioxide (CO2) and
water (H2O) in the presence of light are converted
into glucose (C6H12O6) by the following chemical
equation:
6CO2 + 6H2O + light → C6H12O6 + 6O2.
Further processes in the plant make more complex
molecules from the glucose. The exact makeup of
biomass varies with type, but in general it has the
chemical formula of (CH2O)n and on average is about
75 percent carbohydrates or sugars and 25 percent
lignin, a polymer that holds plant fibers together.
Biofuels are used to create a wide variety of energy
sources. Ever since the harnessing of fire, biomass has
been used for heating and cooking. Residential burning
of biomass continues to be a primary source of
fuel in less industrialized nations, but also has been
used as fuel for electricity generation, and converted
to liquid transportation fuels.
CURRENT USE OF BIOFUELS
Despite the fact that the world’s biomass reserves are
declining due to competing land use and deforestation,
worldwide there remains more energy stored in
biomass than there is in the known reserves of fossil
fuels. Trees account for the largest amount of biomass.
Currently biomass is the source of about percent
of the energy used worldwide, primarily wood
and animal dung used for residential heating and
cooking. In developing countries, where electricity
and motor vehicles are more scarce, use of biofuels is
significantly higher (approximately 35 percent on
average). At the higher end are countries such as
India, where about 55 percent of the energy supply
comes from biomass. Geography also is a determining
factor; in some industrialized countries that have
large sources of natural biomass forests near urban
cities, such as Finland, Sweden, and Austria, there is
a relatively high utilization of bioenergy (18, 16, and
13 percent, respectively). Municipal waste, which can
be incinerated for energy production, also can be a
large source of biomass for developed regions.
France, Denmark and Switzerland recover 40, 60,
and 80 percent of their municipal waste respectively.
At the low end is the United States, where biomass
energy accounted for only about 3 percent (2.7
quadrillion Btus) of the total energy consumption in
1997. However, biomass use had been rising over the
previous five years at an average rate of about 1 to 2
percent per year, but fell in 1997 due to a warmerthan-
average heating season. Bioenergy produced in
the United States is primarily from wood and wood
waste and municipal solid waste.
These divergent energy production patterns
between the developing world and the United States
are understandable. Heating and cooking are the
major uses of biomass in the developing world
because of affordability, availability, and convenience.
In the United States, where clean and convenient natural
gas, propane, and electricity are widely available
and affordable, biomass use has limited potential.
Nevertheless, U.S. biomass energy production has
been increasing because of technological advances for
new and improved biomass applications for electricity
generation, gasification, and liquid fuels.
The sources of biofuels and the methods for
bioenergy production are too numerous for an
exhaustive list to be described in detail here. Instead,
electricity production using direct combustion, gasification,
pyrolysis, and digester gas, and two transportation
biofuels, ethanol and biodiesel, are
discussed below.
ELECTRICITY GENERATION
In the United States about 3 percent of all electricity
produced comes from renewable sources; of this a
little more than half comes from biomass. Most biomass
energy generation comes from the lumber and
paper industries from their conversion of mill
residues to in-house energy. Municipal solid waste
also is an important fuel for electricity production;
approximately 16 percent of all municipal solid waste
is disposed of by combustion. Converting industrial
and municipal waste into bioenergy also decreases
the necessity for landfill space.
These applications avoid the major obstacles for
using biomass for electricity generation: fluctuation
in the supply, and the type of biomass available.
Seasonal variations and differing quality of feedstock
are the biggest barriers to more widespread use. This
is especially true for biomass wastes.
COMBUSTION
Combustion is the burning of fuels to produce heat.
To produce energy, the heat from the combustion
process is used to create steam, which in turn drives
turbines to produce electricity.
Most electricity from biofuels is generated by
direct combustion. Wood fuels are burned in stoker
boilers, and mill waste lignin is combusted in special
burners. Plants are generally small, being less than
50 MW in capacity. There is considerable interest in
combustion of biomass in a process called cofiring,
when biomass is added to traditional fuels for electricity
production. Cofiring is usually done by adding
biomass to coal, but biomass also can be cofired with
oil. There are several biomass cofiring plants in commercial
operation in the eastern United States. The
U.S. Department of Energy estimates that by 2020
the capacity for biomass cofiring could reach 20 to 30
GW. Cofiring has the advantage of requiring very little
capital cost since most boilers can accommodate
approximately 5 to 10 percent of biomass without
modifications.
Estimates for delivery fuel costs for woody biomass
range between $1.25 and $3.90 per million Btus
compared to $0.90 to $1.35 per million Btus for coal.
The cost associated with biomass electricity depends
largely on the proximity of the plant to the biomass
source and whether the feed is a waste material. At
10,000 Btu/kWh generation heat rate, each $1 per
million Btus translates to 1 cent per kWh electrical
cost. Thus biomass electricity costs can range from
competitive with coal to several cents per kWh more
expensive.
Cofiring biomass has environmental benefits in
addition to lowering greenhouse gases. Since biomass
has little or no sulfur, sulfur dioxide (SO2) emissions
are less when biomass fuels are used. In the United
States, power plants have allowable sulfur dioxide
levels for each gigawatt of power produced. If they
produce less than the allowable amount of sulfur
dioxide, they receive credits with which they can
trade on the open market. The price for these sulfur
dioxide credits is about $70 to $200 per ton.
Biomass also has lower levels of nitrogen than fossil
fuels, leading to lower nitrogen oxide formation.
The high water content in biomass also lowers the
combustion temperature, decreasing the formation
of thermal nitrogen oxides. In some cases this can
lead to nonlinear reductions; for example, in one
study when 7 percent wood was cofired with coal,
nitrogen oxides emissions decreased by 15 percent.
However, such reductions are not seen in all cases.
Reburning is possible when using most biomass
feedstocks and also can lower emissions.
Use of some biomass feedstocks can increase
potential environmental risks. Municipal solid waste
can contain toxic materials that can produce dioxins
and other poisons in the flue gas, and these should
not be burned without special emission controls.
Demolition wood can contain lead from paint, other
heavy metals, creosote, and halides used in preservative
treatments. Sewage sludge has a high amount of
sulfur, and sulfur dioxide emission can increase if
sewage sludge is used as a feedstock.
GASIFICATION
Gasification of biofuels, which is in the early developmental
stage, has been the focus of much recent
research, since it has the potential of providing high
conversion. During gasification, biomass is converted
to a combustible gas by heating with a substoichiometric
amount of oxygen. The biomass can be heat-
ed either directly or with an inert material such as
sand. In some cases steam is added. The product gas
consists of carbon monoxide, methane and other
hydrocarbons, hydrogen, and noncombustible
species such as carbon dioxide, nitrogen, and water;
the relative amount of each depends on the type of
biomass and the operating conditions. Generally the
product gas has an energy content about one-half to
one-quarter that of natural gas. The gas is cleaned by
removing tars, volatile alkali, ash, and other unwanted
materials. The gas is then sent to a steam boiler or
combustion turbine for electricity production by a
Rankine cycle or a combined cycle (IGCC). Use of
gasification technology with an IGCC can double the
efficiency of average biomass electricity production
using advanced turbine technology.
The capital cost of an IGCC plant for biomass or
coal is in the range of $1,500 to $2,000 per installed
kW. A comparable natural gas fire facility costs about
$750 to $1,000. The economics of biomass electricity
based on IGCC technology depend on the relative
cost of natural gas and biomass fuels. Biomass must
be lower in cost than gas to pay back the additional
capital cost of gas production and cleaning. A 1999
estimate suggestes that the biomass would have to be
$3 per million Btus cheaper than natural gas for biomass
to be economical.
PRYOLYSIS
Another emerging area in biofuels is pyrolysis, which
is the decomposition of biomass into other more
usable fuels using a high-temperature anaerobic
process. Pyrolysis converts biomass into charcoal and
a liquid called biocrude. This liquid has a high energy
density and is cheaper to transport and store than
the unconverted biomass. Biocrude can be burned in
boilers or used in a gas turbine. Biocrude also can be
chemical by altered into other fuels or chemicals.
Use of pyrolysis may make bioenergy more feasible
in regions not near biomass sources. Biocrude is
about two to four times more expensive than petroleum
crude.
BIOGAS PRODUCTION
Biogas is composed primarily of methane (CH4) and
carbon dioxide. Biogas is a by-product from anaerobic
bacteria breaking down organic material. Large
amounts of biogas can be released from areas such as
livestock waste lagoons, sewage treatment plants, and
landfills. Since biogas is primarily methane, it is
similar to natural gas and can be used for energy generation,
especially electricity using stationary enginegenerators.
The goals of capturing biogas are often to
prevent these greenhouse gases from being released
into the atmosphere, to control odor, and to produce
fertilizer; energy production is secondary. Methane is
a potent greenhouse gas, with twenty-one times the
global warming potential of carbon dioxide. However,
when methane is burned, it produces less carbon
dioxide per Btu than any other hydrocarbon fuel.
Economics for generating electricity from biogas
can be favorable. Landfill gas from municipal solid
waste can supply about 4 percent of the energy consumed
in the United States. In 1997, a total of 90 trillion
Btus were generated by landfill gas, about 3
percent of total biomass energy consumption.
TRANSPORTATION FUELS
Although biomass used directly for heating and cooking
is the thermodynamically most efficient use,
followed by use for electricity generation, the economics
are much more favorable to convert to a
liquid fuel. Economic considerations outweigh thermodynamics;
as an electricity generator, biomass
must compete with relatively low-priced coal, but as
a liquid fuel the competition is higher-priced oil.
Transportation fuels are the largest consumers of
crude oil. Petroleum-based transportation fuels are
responsible for 35 percent of greenhouse gas emissions
in the United States. Only percent of
transportation fuels comes from renewable nonpetroleum-
based sources, primarily from the use of cornbased
ethanol blended with gasoline to make gasohol.
Increased use of biofuels could lower some of the pollution
caused by the use of transportation fuels.
ETHANOL
The chemical formula for ethanol is CH3CH2OH.
Ethanol is less toxic and more biodegradable than
gasoline. For its octane boosting capability ethanol can
be use as a fuel additive when blended with gasoline.
Demand for gasoline is 125 billion gals (473 billion
l) per year according to 1998 estimates. The
Clean Air Act Amendment of 1990 mandates the use
of oxygenated fuels such as ethanol blends with up to
3.5 percent oxygen by weight in gasoline (E-10 or
gasohol). Reformulated gasoline (RFG) is required
year-round in areas that are not in compliance for
ozone, and oxyfuels are required in the winter in
areas that are not in compliance for carbon monoxide.
These “program gasolines” total about 40 billion
gals (151 billion l) per year.
In 1997 a total 1.3 billion gals of ethanol fuel was
produced in the United States. Proposed new low
sulfur conventional gasoline standards could greatly
increase the demand for ethanol since desulfurization
may lower gasoline octane. Almost all fuel ethanol is
used as gasohol, but some is used to make E-85 (85%
ethanol and 15% gasoline). E-85 can be used in flexible-
fuel vehicles (FFVs) which can operate on gasoline
or ethanol blends of to 85 percent ethanol.
Eighty-seven percent of the ethanol produced in
the United States comes from corn. The remainder
comes from milo, wheat, food wastes, and a small
amount from wood waste. In Brazil, the largest producer
of transportation biofuels, sugar cane is converted
into ethanol at the rate of 16 billion l per year.
There are 3.6 million cars in Brazil that run on 100
percent ethanol.
Ethanol is more costly to produce than gasoline.
The cost of production of ethanol from corn ranges
from about $0.80 per gal ($0.21 per l) for large depreciated
wet mills to $1.20 per gal ($0.32 per l) for new
dry mills. Better engineering designs, the development
of new coproducts, and better uses for existing
coproducts will help to lower the production cost.
For example, recovering the corn germ in dry mills,
which is currently in the development stage could
lower ethanol production costs by $0.07 to $0.20 per
gal ($0.02 to $0.05 per l). However, ethanol currently
used for fuel is not competitive with gasoline without
a federal excise tax exemption.
While the corn-to-ethanol industry is mature,
conversion of energy crops to ethanol is in the com-
mercial development stage. Engineering studies in
2000 estimate the cost of production per gallon for
biomass ethanol at $1.22 per gal ($ 0.32 per l). The
U.S. Department of Energy projects that technical
advances can lower the cost to $0.60 per gallon. This
would make ethanol competitive (without a tax
exemption ) on an energy basis with gasoline when
petroleum is $25 per barrel.
To use biomass material, ethanol needs to be produced
from the cellulose portion of the biomass, not
just from the starch or sugars. Cellulose is more
resistant to breakdown than starch or sugars, so different
production methods are required. Acid-catalyzed
reactions can be used for the breakdown of
cellulose into products that can be converted into
alcohol. This process, however, is expensive, and
there are problems with the environmental disposal
of dilute acid streams. Research for the development
of an enzyme to break down cellulose began after
World War II. It was discovered that a specific
microbe, Trichoderma reesei, was responsible for the
decomposition of canvas (cellulose) tents in tropical
areas. Research on this microbe and others is being
conducted. Using genetic engineering, new enzymes
are being produced with the primary goal to increase
efficiency of alcohol production from cellulose.
BIODIESEL
Biodiesel is diesel fuel produced from vegetable oils
and other renewable resources. Many different types
of oils can be used, including animal fats, used cooking
oils, and soybean oil. Biodiesel is miscible with
petroleum diesels and can be used in biodiesel-diesel
blends. Most often blends are 20 percent biodiesel
and 80 percent traditional diesel. Soy diesel can be
used neat (100%), but many other types of biodiesel
are too viscous, especially in winter, and must be
used in blends to remain fluid. The properties of the
fuel will vary depending on the raw material used.
Typical values for biodiesel are shown in Table 1.
Biodiesel does not present any special safety concerns.
Pure biodiesel or biodiesel and petroleum
diesel blends have a higher flash point than conventional
diesel, making them safer to store and handle.
Problems can occur with biodiesels in cold weather
due to their high viscosity. Biodiesel has a higher
degree of unsaturation in the fuel, which can make it
vulnerable to oxidation during storage.
To produce biodiesel, the oil is transformed using
a process of transesterification; agricultural oil reacts
with methanol in the presence of a catalyst to form
esters and glycerol. These monoalkyl esters, otherwise
known as biodiesel, can operate in traditional
diesel combustion-ignition engines. Glycerol from
the transesterification process can be sold as a
coproduct. Low petroleum prices continue to make
petroleum-based diesel a more economical choice for
use in diesel engines.
Current consumption of transportation diesel fuel
in the United States is 25 billion gal (94.6 billion l)
per year. The total production of all agricultural
oils in the United States is about 2 billion gal (7.6
billion l) per year of which 75 percent is from soybeans.
Total commodity waste oils total about 1 billion
gal (3.8 billion l) per year. The amount of other
truly waste greases cannot be quantified. Sewage trap
greases consist of primarily free fatty acids and are
disposed of for a fee. Trap greases might amount to
300 million gal (1.1 billion l) per year of biodiesel
feedstock. The production of biodiesel esters in the
United States in 1998 was about 30 million gal (114
million l). The most common oil used is soybean oil,
accounting for 75 percent of oil production used for
most biodiesel work. Rapeseed oil is the most common
starting oil for biodiesel in Europe.
Production costs for biodiesel from soybean oil
exceeds $2.00 per gal ($0.53 per l), compared to $0.55
to $0.65 per gal ($0.15 to $0.17 per l) for conventional
diesel. The main cost in biodiesel is in the raw
material. It takes about 7.7 lb (3.5 kg) of soybean oil
valued at about $0.25 per lb (0.36 per kg) to make 1
gal (3.8l) of biodiesel. Waste oils, valued at $1 per gal
($3.79 per l) or less, have the potential to provide low
feedstock cost. However, much “waste oil” is currently
collected, reprocessed as yellow and white
greases, and used for industrial purposes and as an
animal feed supplement. Production of biodiesel
from less expensive feedstocks such as commodity
waste oil still costs more than petroleum diesel.
Research has been done to develop fast-growing
high-lipid microalgae plants for use in biodiesel production.
These microalgae plants require high
amounts of solar radiation and could be grown in the
southwestern United States.
In addition to greenhouse benefits, biodiesels offer
environmental advantages over conventional diesel.
Biodiesels produce similar NOx emissions to conventional
diesel, fuel but less particulate matter.
Biodiesel is more biodegradable that conventional
diesel making any spills less damaging in sensitive
areas. In general biodiesel provides more lubrication
to the fuel system than low-sulfur diesel.
ENERGY INPUT-ENERGY OUTPUT
OF BIOFUELS
Since the Sun, through photosynthesis, provides
most of the energy in biomass production, energy
recovered from biofuels can be substantially larger
than the nonsolar energy used for the harvest and
production. Estimates on conversion efficiency
(energy out to non-solar energy in) of ethanol can be
controversial and vary widely depending on the
assumptions for type of crop grown and farming and
production methods used. Net energy gain estimates
for converting corn to ethanol vary between 21 and
38 percent. Conversion efficiencies can be increased
if corn stover (leaves and stocks) is also used and converted
to ethanol. Research is being conducted on
converting other crops into ethanol. Switchgrass, a
perennial, is one of the most promising alternatives.
It has a net energy gain as high as 330 percent since it
only has to be replanted about every ten years and
because there are low chemical and fertilizer requirements.
Net energy gains for the production of
biodiesel are also high, with estimates ranging
between 320 and 370 percent.
FUTURE USE OF BIOFUELS
One of the main benefits from future use of biofuels
would be the reduction of greenhouse gases compared
to the use of fossil fuels. Carbon dioxide, a
greenhouse gas that contributes to global warming, is
released into the air from combustion. Twenty-four
percent of worldwide energy-related carbon emissions
in 1997 were from the United States. Carbon
and due to rising energy consumption, are expected
to increase 1.3 percent per year through 2015.
When plants grow, they adsorb carbon dioxide
from the atmosphere. If these plants are used for biofuels,
the carbon dioxide released into the atmosphere
during combustion is that which was adsorbed from
the atmosphere while they were growing. Therefore
the net balance of carbon dioxide from the use of biofuels
is near zero. Since some fossil fuel use is
required in both the planting and the production of
bioenergy, there are some net carbon dioxide and
other greenhouse gases released into the atmosphere.
In determining the net carbon dioxide balance,
important variables include growth rates, type of biomass,
efficiency of biomass conversion, and the type
of fossil fuel used for production. The amount of carbon
accumulated in the soil and the amount of fertilizers
used also have a large effect on the carbon
balance. In particular, nitrous oxide (N2O), a powerful
greenhouse gas, can be released as a result of fertilizer
application. Estimates for the amount of
greenhouse emissions recycled using biomass for
energy production range from a low of 20 to a high of
95 percent. Wood and perennial crops have higher
greenhouse gas reduction potential than annual crops.
Using biomass to replace energy intensive materials
also can increase the carbon balance in favor of energy
crops. It is estimated that the nation’s annual carbon
dioxide emissions could be reduced by 6 percent
if 34.6 million acres were used to grow energy crops.
There is some greenhouse gas benefit from planting
forests or other biomass and leaving the carbon
stored in the plants by not harvesting. However, over
the long term, increased carbon dioxide benefits are
realized by using land that is not currently forested
for growing some energy crops such as fast-growing
poplar. The added benefits come from the displacing
fossil fuels by the use of biofuels, since energy crops
can be repeatedly harvested over the same land.
In the calculation of greenhouse gas benefits of
planting energy crops, many assumptions are made.
Among them is that the land will be well managed,
appropriate crops for the region will be used, there
will be careful use of fertilizers and other resources,
and efficient production methods will be employed
to get the maximum amount of energy from the biomass.
Most importantly, it is assumed that biomass is
grown in a sustainable manner. Harvested biomass
that is not replanted increases greenhouse gas emissions
in two ways: Carbon dioxide that had been previously 
stored in trees is released in the atmosphere,
and future carbon fixation is stopped.
To comply with carbon reduction goals, some
countries impose taxes on carbon dioxide emissions.
Since biofuels have lower full-cycle carbon dioxide
emissions than fossil fuels, biofuels are more costcompetitive
with fossil fuels in regions where these
taxes are imposed.
Another advantage to using biomass as an energy
source is a possible increase in energy security for
countries that import fossil fuels. More than twothirds
of the oil reserves are in the Middle East. More
than half of the oil consumed in the United States is
imported and oil accounts for approximately 40 percent
of the trade deficit of the United Sates. A substantial
biofuels program could help to the increase
energy independence of importing nations and lessen
the impact of an energy crisis.
There are some disadvantages with the use of biofuels
as well. Some of the high-yield energy crops
also have significant removal rates of nutrients from
the soil. Each year the cultivation of row crops
causes a loss of 2.7 million metric tons of soil organic
matter in the United States. However, there are
exceptions: Through the use of good farming practices,
Brazilian sugarcane fields have had minimal
deterioration from the repeated planting of sugarcane.
Moreover, using switchgrass and other grasses
increases soil organic matter and thus can help in
reducing the soil erosion caused by the cultivation of
rowcrops. Research is being conducted into improving
sustainable crop yield with a minimal of fertilizer
application. Possible solutions include coplanting
energy crops with nitrogen-fixing crops to maintain
nitrogen levels in the soil.
It is estimated that biomass is cultivated at a rate of
220 billion dry tons per year worldwide. This is about
ten times worldwide energy consumption. Advocates
suggest that by 2050, better use of cultivated biomass
could lead to biomass providing 38 percent of the
world’s direct fuel and 17 percent of electricity generation.
However, a large increase in bioenergy seems
unlikely. When the U.S. Energy Information
Administration (EIA) does not include any new
greenhouse gas legislation into its energy utilization
projections, only limited growth for renewable energy
is predicted. The EIA estimates an average increase
of 0.8 percent per year for fuels through 2020 and an
average increase of 0.5 percent for renewable electrical
generation without new legislation. Most of the
increase comes from wind, municipal solid waste, and
other biomass. The reason for low expected growth in
biofuels is that natural gas and petroleum prices are
expected to remain relatively low over the next few
decades; in 2020 the average crude oil price is projected
to be $22.73 a barrel (in 1997 dollars). The average
wellhead price for natural gas is projected to increase
from $2.23 per thousand cu ft ($2.17 per million Btus
to $2.68 per thousand cu ft ($2.61 per million Btus in
2020 (prices in 1997 dollars). Low fossil fuel prices
make it difficult for alternative fuels to compete.
Projections for the amount of biomass energy use do
rise, however, if it is assumed that the Kyoto protocols
limiting greenhouse gases will be adopted, since biofuels
contribute fewer greenhouse emissions than do
fossil fuels. In the case where greenhouse gas emissions
are kept to 1990 levels, renewable energy could
account for as much as 22 percent of electricity generation
in 2020. Even under this scenario, the biggest
change in greenhouse gas emissions comes from a
decrease in coal use and an increase in natural gas use.
While considerable amounts of biomass exist as
wastes, the costs of collection, storage, transportation,
and preparation are high. The largest obstacle for the
wider us of biofuels is economics, but niche opportunities
exist. Strategies to improve economics
include extracting high-valued coproducts from the
cellulosic matrix, offsetting disposal costs and mitigating
environmental problems by using the waste.
Agricultural wastes such as corn stover (stalks,
leaves, etc.) have been proposed as bioenergy sources.
The annual planted corn acreage is near 80 million
acres, and up to 1.5 tons of stover per acre could be
collected. In many farm locations stover has a competitive
use as animal feed, but in areas where highervalued
uses do not exist, it may be collected and used
as an industrial feedstock. In California, rice straw
presents a disposal problem, since burning has been
disallowed, and the rice straw could be used for
ethanol production. Alfalfa growers in Minnesota are
developing a technology to separate stems from the
protein-containing leaves. Since protein sources are
economically valued on a ton-of-protein basis, the
stems are available at essentially no cost for electricity
generation. Diversion of demolition wood collected
in urban areas from landfills also could yield low-cost
fuels. However, if biomass is to become a large component
of U.S. energy use, it will have to be grown
commercially as an energy crop.
Because the energy density of biomass is much
lower than that of fossil fuels, most cost analyses suggest
that in order for conversion of biomass to fuels
to be economical, the biomass source needs to be
close to the processing facility, usually within fifty
miles. Lower energy density also means that storage
costs can be higher than with fossil fuels, and unlike
fossil fuels, it is wholly important that storage time is
minimized because weather and bacteria can lower
the energy quality of the biomass.
The U.S. Department of Agriculture reports that
in 1997 there were 432 million acres of cropland in
the United States, of which 353 million acres were
planted. Idled cropland accounted for 79 million
acres, of which 33 million acres were in the
Conservation Reserve Program (CRP). Some planted
cropland as well as some or all the idled cropland
may be available for energy crops depending on the
ability of energy crops to compete economically with
traditional crops and on public policy related to the
use of CRP land. A 1999 study from University of
Tennessee’s Agricultural Policy Analysis Center and
Oak Ridge National Laboratory used the POLYSYS
(Policy Analysis System) model to estimate the
amount of land that might be used for energy crops
in 2008 based on two different scenarios. Under both
scenarios it is assumed that producers are allowed to
keep 75 percent of the rental rate paid by the U.S.
government for CRP acreage. In both cases, switchgrass
was the energy crop with the most economic
potential. In the first scenario, it is assumed that the
price for energy crops is $30 per dry ton ($2 per million
Btus) and there are strict management practices
in the CRP; in this case it is estimated that switchgrass
would be competitive on 7.4 million acres. In
the second scenario, it is assumed that the price for
energy crops is $40 per dry ton ($2.70/per million
Btus) and that there are lenient management practices
in the CRP; under this scenario it is estimated
that switchgrass would be competitive on 41.9 million
acres. This would result in an increased annual
ethanol production on the order of 4 billion to 21 billion
gal (15 billion to 79 billion l) compared to the
current corn ethanol production of about 1.5 billion
gal (5.7 billion l) per year, or sufficient fuel for 6,000
to 36,000 MW of electrical generating capacity. Such
a program could provide additional benefit to farmers
by reducing the supply of commodity crops and in
turn raising crop prices.
With dedicated feedstock supply systems, energy
crops are grown with the primary purpose of energy
generation. This means that fuel processors and
growers will need to enter into long-term fuel supply
contracts that provide early incentives to growers to
tie up land. Woody species require four to seven years
from planting to harvest. Switchgrass crops require
approximately two years from planting to first harvest.
High-growth species of poplar, sycamore, eucalyptus,
silver maple, and willow are all being tested as energy
crops. Hybrid species are being developed for pest and
disease resistance. Willows have the advantage that
common farm equipment can be modified for harvesting.
Selection of biomass depends on many factors
including climate, soil, and water availability.
Research is being done in the United States and
worldwide to lower some of the barriers to biofuels.
Researchers hope to develop high-yield, fast-growing
feedstocks for reliable biomass fuel supplies.
Research is also being done to improve the efficiency
of energy conversion technologies so that more of the
biomass is utilized.
