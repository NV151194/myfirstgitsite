BERNOULLI, DANIEL
(1700–1782)
Daniel Bernoulli, the son of Johann Bernoulli, was
born in Groningen while his father held a chair of
mathematics at the university. He was born into a
dynasty of mathematicians who were prone to bitter
rivalry. His father tried to map out Daniel’s life by
selecting a wife and a career for him. By the time
Daniel was thirteen, his father was reconciled to the
fact that his son would never be a merchant, but
absolutely refused to allow him to take up mathematics,
decreeing that Daniel would become a doctor.
Daniel gained his baccalaureate in 1715 and
master’s degree in 1716 at Basle University, but,
while studying philosophy at Basle, he began learning
about the calculus from his father and his older
brother Nikolas. He studied medicine at Heidelberg
in 1718, Strasbourg in 1719, and then returned to
Basle in 1720 to complete his doctorate. About this
time, he was attracted to the work of William
Harvey, On the Movement of Heat and Blood in
Animals, which combined his interests in mathematics
and fluids. By 1720 his father had introduced
him to what would later be called “conservation of
energy,” which he applied in his medical studies,
writing his doctoral dissertation on the mechanics of
breathing.
After completing his medical studies in 1721, he
applied for a chair at Basle, but like his father before
him, he lost out in a lottery. Disappointed with his
lack of success, he accepted an invitation from
Catherine I, Empress of Russia, to become Professor
of Mathematics at the Imperial Academy in St.
Petersburg in 1725. Catherine was so desperate to
secure Daniel that she agreed to offer a second chair
to his brother, Nikolas. Unfortunately, Nikolas died
of tuberculosis shortly after arriving in Russia.
Despondent over his death, Daniel thought of
returning home, but stayed when his father suggested
that one of his own students, Leonard Euler,
would make an able assistant.
Bernoulli and Euler dominated the mechanics of
flexible and elastic bodies for many years. They also
investigated the flow of fluids. In particular, they
wanted to know about the relationship between the
speed at which blood flows and its pressure.
Bernoulli experimented by puncturing the wall of a
pipe with a small, open-ended straw, and noted that
as the fluid passed through the tube the height to
which the fluid rose up the straw was related to
fluid’s pressure. Soon physicians all over Europe
were measuring patients’ blood pressure by sticking
pointed-ended glass tubes directly into their arteries.
(It was not until 1896 that an Italian doctor discovered
a less painful method that is still in widespread
use.) However, Bernoulli’s method of measuring air
pressure is still used today to measure the airspeed of
airplanes. Around the same time, he made yet another
fundamental discovery when he showed that the
movements of strings of musical instruments are
composed of an infinite number of harmonic vibrations,
all superimposed on the string.
Another major contribution that Bernoulli made
while in Russia was the discovery that whereas a
moving body traded its kinetic energy for potential
energy when it gained height, a moving fluid traded
its kinetic energy for pressure. In terms of mathematical
symbols, the law of conservation of energy
becomes:
P + ρ v2 = constant,
where P is pressure, ρ is the density of the fluid and
v is its velocity. A consequence of this law is that if
the pressure falls, then the velocity or the density
must increase, and conversely. This explains how an
airplane wing can generate lift: the air above a wing
travels faster than that below it, creating a pressure
difference.
By 1730 Bernoulli longed to return to Basle, but
despite numerous attempts, he lost out in ballots for
academic positions until 1732. However, in 1734 the
French Academy of Sciences awarded a joint prize to
Daniel and his father in recognition of their work.
Johann found it difficult to admit that his son was at
least his equal, and once again the house of Bernoulli
was divided.
Of all the work that Bernoulli carried out in
Russia, perhaps the most important was in hydrodynamics,
a draft account of which was completed in
1734. The final version appeared in 1738 with the
frontispiece “Hydrodynamica, by Daniel Bernoulli,
Son of Johann.” It is thought that Daniel identified
himself in this humble fashion in an attempt to
mend the conflict between himself and his father.
Hydrodynamica contains much discussion on the
principle of conservation of energy, which he had
studied with his father since 1720. In addition, it
gives the basic laws for the theory of gases and gave,
although not in full detail, the equation of state discovered
by Johannes Van der Waals a century later.
A year later, his father published his own work,
Hydraulics, which appeared to have a lot in common
with that of his son, and the talk was of blatant
plagiarism.
Hydrodynamica marked the beginning of fluid
dynamics—the study of the way fluids and gases
behave. Each particle in a gas obeys Isaac Newton’s
laws of motion, but instead of simple planetary
motion, a much richer variety of behavior can be
observed. In the third century B.C.E., Archimedes of
Syracuse studied fluids at rest, hydrostatics, but it was
nearly 2,000 years before Daniel Bernoulli took the
next step. Using calculus, he combined Archimedes’
idea of pressure with Newton’s laws of motion. Fluid
dynamics is a vast area of study that can be used to
describe many phenomena, from the study of simple
fluids such as water, to the behavior of the plasma in
the interior of stars, and even interstellar gases.
After the dispute with his father in 1734, Daniel
Bernoulli lost much of his drive to study mathematics
and turned his attention to medicine and physiology.
Finally, in 1750, Daniel was appointed chair of
physics at Basle, where he taught until his death on
March 17, 1782.
