BECQUEREL,
ALEXANDRE-EDMOND
(1820–1891)
Edmond Becquerel was one of a family of scientists.
His father, Antoine-César, was professor of physics at
the Muséum d’Histoire Naturelle, and his son,
[Antoine-]Henri Becquerel, also a physicist, discovered
the phenomenon of radioactivity (for which he
received the Nobel Prize in 1903).
The scientific work of Edmond began in 1838, at
the very early age of eighteen. When the Chair of
Professor of Physics Applied to Natural History was
created for his father at the Muséum d’Histoire
Naturelle, Edmund had the dilemma of choosing to
attend l’Ecole Normale, l’Ecole Polytechnique, or
become an assistant to his father for the course that
went with the professorship. He chose to assist his
father, and their collaboration continued for decades.
Thus, his title on the title page of the book published
in 1855-1856 with his father is given as: “Professeur
au Conservatoire impérial des Arts et Métiers, Aidenaturaliste
au Muséum d’Histoire Naturelle, etc.”
After a short period as assistant at la Sorbonne, and
then as Professor at the Institut Agronomique de
Versailles, he became Professor at the Conservatoire
des Arts et Métiers in 1852, where he worked for
almost forty years. When his father died in 1878,
Edmond succeeded him as director of the Muséum
in addition to his professorship. He received a degree
as Doctor of Science from the University of Paris in
1840, and was elected a member of l’Académie des
Sciences in 1863.
He published a great number of scientific articles
and a number of books: the three volume Traité
d’électricité et de magnétisme, et des applications de
ces sciences á la chimie, á la physiologie et aux arts.
(1855-1856 with his father); Recherches sur divers
effets lumineux qui résultent de l’action de la lumiére
sur les corps (1859); and La lumiére, ses causes et ses
effets 1867, in two volumes.
Electricity, magnetism, and light were the main
subjects of his work. At the time, these subjects were
“hot” topics. Hans Christian Ørsted had made his
discovery that an electric current had an effect on a
magnet in the year Edmond was born. Michael
Faraday had just (in 1831) discovered the effect of
induction, and Louis Daguerre invented the photographic
plate in 1837, the year before Edmund began
his scientific work. Edmond set out to study the
chemical effect of light, and in 1839 he discovered a
remarkable effect: electricity was emitted following
the chemical actions due to the light—the photoelectric
effect. He was thus led to the construction of the
“actinometer,” which allows the measurement of
light intensities by measuring the electric current
generated by the light. Using photographic plates, he
examined the sunlight spectrum and discovered that
the dark lines, observed by Fraunhofer in the visible
part, continue into the violet and ultraviolet region,
and that the plates, when exposed briefly to ultraviolet
radiation, become sensitive to the red part as well,
and can actually acquire an image without development
of the plates.
Parallel to these investigations, he continued
(with his father) to study electricity. He used the
method of compensation to measure the resistivity
of a large number of materials, including liquid solutions.
The effect of the electrodes was, in the latter
case, taken into account by using tubes in which it
was possible to change the distance between the
electrodes. Electrochemical effects and their practical
applications were also a main concern. The second
volume of the “Traité ...” is mainly concerned
with the feasibility of extracting silver from minerals
in Mexico by electrochemical methods as opposed to
the methods then in use involving either charcoal or
mercury. Mercury was expensive and charcoal was
becoming increasingly expensive due to the shortage
of wood. In the introduction to the “Traité ...” he
mentions that if the consumption of wood in
Mexico continued at the ten current rate, it would
have severe effects, and that the Mexican government
should be concerned. (It is at this point worth
noting that Mexico had obtained independence in
1821, and the subject of French intervention in the
internal wars that followed was a major political
issue.) He studied extensively the electromotive
force and internal resistance of a large number of
batteries. He and his father used the thermoelectric
effect to construct thermometers that could measure
temperatures that were otherwise difficult to measure
and at places that were hard to access by other
means. The temperature in the ground was, for
instance, measured throughout the year.
Another study was begun, in 1839, with Jean-
Baptiste Biot (who had measured quantitatively the
force that an electric current produces on a magnet,
the effect that Ørsted had discovered qualitatively),
namely, on phosphorescence, fluorescence and luminescence.
To study the phenomenon that certain
substances emit light after having been exposed to
light, Becquerel devised an ingenious apparatus. The
main idea was to have two discs with holes in them
rotating about an axis parallel to the beam of light
illuminating the sample placed between the discs.
The sample receives light only when a hole passes in
front of it; otherwise, the disc blocks the path of light.
Likewise, the emitted light is observed only when a
hole in the other disc passes the sample and can be
examined at varying times after the exposure by
changing either the relative positions of the holes or
by changing the speed of rotation. Furthermore, a
prism could be inserted in the path of the emitted
light and spectral analysis performed. With this simple
apparatus he was able to reduce to 1/40,000 of a
second the time separating the luminous excitation
and the observation. A number of important results
were obtained; for instance, that fluorescence differed
from phosphorescence only by its very short
duration, and that the spectrum of the fluorescent
light is characteristic for each substance (one of the
first instances of nondestructive testing).
The discovery and detailed investigations of the
phenomenon of fluorescence is generally considered
the main contribution of Edmond Becquerel. It had
the further impact of leading later to the discovery of
radioactivity by his son Henri, as Henri continued
these studies, including among the substances examined
salts of uranium.
Edmond Becquerel was interested in and dedicated
to science in general. He was a very careful and
imaginative experimenter with an acute sense of the
practical aspects of science. He put great effort and
insight into exploring the practical uses of physics,
especially the new phenomena of electricity and magnetism
or, when combined, electromagnetism.
