BICYCLING
Bicycling is a simple, affordable, and energy-efficient
means of transportation. Of all human-powered locomotion,
it is the fastest and least energy-demanding.
The bicycle has stunning efficiency advantages
over other vehicles for several reasons:
• It weighs roughly one-fifth of its payload weight. (By
comparison, even a small motorcycle weighs more
than the rider.)
• With the exception of avid sport and competitive use,
it is typically operated at low speeds that do not cause
high aerodynamic drag.
• Its internal mechanical efficiency can be nearly perfect—
a 1999 test at Johns Hopkins University
showed chain efficiencies as high as 98.6 percent—
and energy losses due to rolling resistance are far less
than for other vehicles.
The light weight and mechanical efficiency not
only allow the bicycle to be powered by a nonathletic
human, but it can be walked over extreme terrain,
or laden with heavy cargo, or picked up and carried.
These options make the bicycle more versatile than
any other vehicle, and allow a bicycle user door-todoor,
on-demand transport.
For any given speed, the energy demands are close
to half that of running, and 15 to 20 percent that of
ice skating or roller skating. Moreover, better bikes,
better techniques, and better athletes continually
help set new speed and endurance records. The
record speeds accomplished with recumbent twowheeled
bikes enclosed in an aerodynamic shield
have surpassed 110 kilometers per hour (68 miles per
hour). The record distance that cyclists can cover in
an hour on an unfaired (no separate process to makeit
more aerodynamic), upright bike has risen from 35
kilometers (21.7 miles) in the 1890s to over 51 kilometers
(31.7 miles) in the 1990s.
The bicycle’s energy efficiency superiority extends
beyond human locomotion and beyond all other
forms of transportation. By converting food into the
energy equivalent of gasoline, the kilocalories of food
energy needed by a human to pedal a bicycle is only
a fraction of that needed to propel planes, trains, and
automobiles (see Table 1).
HISTORY
Bicycles have been around since the early part of the
nineteenth century. In 1817 Karl Von Drais invented
a walking machine to get around the royal gardens
faster. Made entirely of wood, the rider straddled two
same-size, in-line wheels, steering with the front
wheel and locomoting by pushing against the
ground. This steerable hobby horse, which could
surpass runners and horse-drawn carriages, never
became a viable transportation option because of the
need for smooth pathways, which were rare at that
time.
A second major effort at self-propelled transportation
came when Pierre Michaux invented in 1861 the
velocipede (“fast foot”) that applied pedals directly to
the front wheel. To achieve greater speed with every
pedal revolution, designers tried larger and larger
front wheels, with some reaching almost two meters
in diameter. Despite garnering interest from hobbyists,
the velocipede had three major deficiencies as
transportation: First, lacking gears, it was difficult to
climb even a modest grade; second, because the construction
was entirely of wood, with metal tires coming
slightly later, the cobblestone roads of the day
made for an extremely uncomfortable ride; third, the
big front wheel created problems. Riding was
extremely dangerous and inaccessible to most
women and children.
A fresh start and the true beginning of bicycles
becoming a popular means of transportation can be
traced to around 1886 and the efforts of John Kemp
Starley and William Sutton. With equal-sized wheels,
tubular steel diamond-shaped frame geometry, and a
chain-and-sprocket chain drive to the rear wheel, the
“safety bike” looked much like the modern version.
During the late 1890s, bicycles were the worldwide
focus of invention and technical innovation, much as
biotech engineering and computers are today. We owe
many of today’s industrial manufacturing processes,
designs for bearings, axles, and gearing mechanisms,
and the knowledge of lightweight structures, to the
explosion of inventions that bicycles produced.
In the United States, England, and other major
nations, patents were awarded at the rate of about
5,000 per year per nation. In one peak year, bicyclerelated
patents comprised close to one-third of all
patent-writing activity. Many of these patents were
decades ahead of the technology to manufacture
them; for example, suspension systems invented a
century ago became viable only with modern-day
elastic materials and manufacturing technology.
The two most important single inventions of this
long-ago era were Starley’s tension-spoked wheel and
John Dunlop’s pneumatic tire. The tension-spoked
wheel was and is a marvel of lightweight structures; it
allows four ounces of spokes, on a wheel weighing a
total of three or four pounds, to support a 200-pound
rider. (Today’s carbon fiber wheels have yet to show
a clear advantage over the wheel made from humble
carbon steel spokes.) The pneumatic tire, which
Dunlop invented in 1888, vastly improved the bike’s
comfort, and it also shielded the lightweight working
mechanisms from excess vibration and fatigue. The
coaster brake appeared in 1889, and it has been a staple
of children’s bikes ever since.
Because a bicycle uses a low-power engine (the
rider) and because that rider can only apply power
only over a small rpm range, gearing is essential to
match the rider’s output to the riding conditions.
The first patent for bicycle gears was granted in
France in 1868; the rider pedaled forward for one
gear and backward for the other gear.
An 1869 patent by France’s Barberon and Meunier
foresaw today’s derailleurs. It described a mechanism
that would shift a belt or chain sideways among three
sprockets or discs. That same year, Barberon and
Meunier also patented a primitive gear hub.
These technical innovations dramatically improved
performance. Bicycles of that era were hand-made in
cottage industries, and were highly sought after and
expensive. So impassioned were their owners that the
League of American Wheelmen, founded in 1880, was
for several years around the turn of the century the
strongest political lobby in the United States, with a
membership in the hundreds of thousands. The
League’s “Good Roads Movement” was the first political
movement to lobby for a network of high-quality,
paved roads throughout the nation.
Between the development of the chain-drive bicycle
in the 1880s, and before Henry Ford popularized
the automobile in the 1910s and 1920s, bicycling was
extremely popular as an efficient means to quickly get
around. It was over three times as fast as walking, and
more convenient and cheaper than having a horsedrawn
carriage at one’s disposal. Unfortunately, the
quickly improving performance, reliability and
affordability of the automobile made it a formidable
competitor to the bicycle.
The automobile ascended to dominance in North
America starting in the 1920s, and in Europe by the
1950s. After World War II, most nonauto ground
transport in the United States rapidly disappeared.
The decades following World War II saw vast reductions
in train travel, bus service, and public transportation
systems in major cities.
The shift to personal autos was slower in many
European countries, where many of the population
could not afford autos, and where the governments
placed very high taxes on gasoline and automobiles.
Bicycles, motorcycles and public transportation continued
to be widely used in these countries. In addition
to the economic factor, there was a cultural
reason for Europe’s slower embrace of the automobile.
Europeans have long lived with high population
density within finite borders. The United States of
the 1940s was a far more rural nation, with sprawling
farmland inside the borders of major cities. That autos
took up lots of space in a city was an obvious drawback
to the European mind, but irrelevant in Texas.
The poorer nations of the planet had no choice,
and used bicycles and public transportation exclusively.
For example, when China was under Mao Tse
Tung’s rule, the number of private automobiles was
only in the hundreds.
Beginning in the 1970s, the bicycle saw a resurgence
of interest in North America. Reasons included
environmental concerns with the internal combustion
engine, the popularity of bicycling as a multifaceted
sport (racing, touring, mountain-bike riding,
family cycling), the desire for fitness, and the need for
alternative ways of commuting in crowded cities.
Bicycling to work is viewed as the most environmentally
friendly means of travel, the best way to
avoid congested roadways (in some cases, it turns out
to be quicker than mass transit or driving), and a
means of turning commuting time to exercise time.
The bicycle is far more efficient than the automobile
in making good use of city streets. Traffic counts
taken during the 1980 New York City transit strike
showed that a single street lane devoted to bicycles
could carry six to eight times the number of people
per hour than as a lane for auto traffic.
During these past few decades, the bicycle itself
has vastly improved. The bicycles of the early 1970s
usually had mechanical idiosyncrasies. Competition
among manufacturers, led by the Japanese companies
that entered the U.S. market, resulted in vastly
improved quality control. The mountain bike, first
made available on a widespread basis in 1983, offered
a delightful alternative that mushroomed in popularity,
and a decade later, traditional “road” bicycles had
all but disappeared from stores. The mountain bike
has become most people’s vehicle of choice for city
riding as well as recreational trail riding.
It has also helped that the bicycle buyer is continually
offered more bicycle for less money. No longer
are most bikes steel. While steel continues to be a fine
material, the dominant material reported by bike
enthusiast is now aluminum, which, in the hands of
most designers, yields a lighter but more rigid frame.
Well-heeled bicyclists opt for titanium or carbonfiber
composites.
There has also been a huge improvement in the
value of today’s mountain bikes. A mountain bike in
the $300 to $500 price range typically has a suspension
fork and aluminum frame that would have made
it a $1,500 bike a decade earlier. The $800 dual-suspension
bike of 2000 far outclasses the early 1990s
$2,500 offering.
THE HUMAN ENGINE
The bicycle’s advantages as the world’s most mechanically
efficient means of transportation are clouded by
the limitations of the human engine. To put it in
power output terms, the human body can produce
sustained power only at modest levels. For most people,
100 watts would be too much, and for an elite
athlete, 400 watts is the approximate ceiling. (The athlete
may manage a brief burst of 1.1 kilowatts.)
The lower power output is inevitable because a
body cannot long produce more power than it can
simultaneously convert from the chemical mixing of
blood glucose and oxygen (aerobic exercise). The
higher brief bursts of power do not rely on real-time
glucose/oxygen consumption, which is why the athlete
is out of breath for minutes afterwards. The athlete’s
muscles have “borrowed” the results of future
oxygen and glucose consumption in anaerobic exercise.
For long-distance travel, yet another limitation
appears: the body stores about a two-hour supply of
glucose. After that glucose is exhausted, the body has
to revert to the far less desirable mechanism of burning
fat. The muscles produce less power with fat than
they do with glucose, and only a trained endurance
athlete can comfortably exercise beyond the glucose
barrier into the fat-burning zone.
When the automobile became preeminent in the
early twentieth century, it did so with good reason.
Whether the energy to power a bicycle is anaerobic or
aerobic in nature, it is still minuscule in comparison
to what an automobile’s internal combustion engine
can deliver. In the United States, almost all subcompact
cars are equipped with engines that can generate
100 or more horsepower (74,600 watts), and can sustain
this output all day long.
The human engine cannot match this power output,
yet the mechanical efficiency of the bicycle helps
tremendously because a very small amount of horsepower
can generate great speed. For example, 0.4
horsepower (298 watts) of output can result in 25
mph (40 kph) speeds or better. One set of calculations
shows that if a cyclist rode on level ground, with
no rolling resistance, and aided by a 25 mph tailwind,
it would require only around 0.2 horsepower (150
watts) to sustain a 25 mph pace.
Gravitational Resistance
If not for the need to climb steep hills, bicycling at
a 15 mph (24 kph) clip would never be a strenuous
exercise. It takes approximately 82 watts, or 0.11
horsepower, on an efficient bicycle, to ride 15 mph
on flat ground. But ground is seldom flat. That same
82 watts achieves only 8 mph climbing a barely discernible
two percent grade. A five percent grade
slows one down to just over 4 mph. Most riders don’t
want to slow down that much, so they work harder to
maintain some speed. On descents, they work less
hard, while going still faster.
Any weight reduction helps. Gravitational forces
do not discriminate between bike and rider mass, but
the human body does. If one spends an extra thousand
dollars to shave ten pounds off a bike, there will
be a 10-pound advantage, but if one sheds the 10
pounds from the belly, the body will not have to nurture
those ten pounds of living tissue, and one will be
a more efficient engine.
Air Resistance
Air resistance is a greater factor than most people
realize. Even at 10 mph on flat ground, almost half
the rider’s energy goes to overcoming wind resistance.
Rolling resistance is almost nil at the speed. At
15 mph, two thirds of the energy is need to overcome
wind resistance. At 25 mph, about 85 percent of the
rider’s energy is devoted to overcoming wind resistance,
with the remainder overcoming rolling resistance
and the tiny frictional losses within the bicycle
itself. So sensitive is the wind resistance to the rider’s
aerodynamic profile that riders who race time trials at
these speeds feel the bike slow down dramatically if
they sit up to take a drink from their water bottles.
For these reasons, most riders cannot, or will not,
increase their speed much above their personal comfort
levels, even with lots of training. The additional
speed just costs the rider too much energy. A rider
going 15 mph must double his power output to ride
20 mph. Why these dramatic numbers? Wind resistance
varies with the square of the rider’s airspeed, but
the energy to overcome wind resistance increases
with the cube of the rider’s airspeed.
Of course, the air is rarely still, just as the ground is
rarely flat. Tailwinds do speed the rider, but headwinds
have a direct effect on the rider’s speed, too: A
rider traveling at 20 mph into a 15 mph (24 kph) headwind
encounters as much air resistance as a rider traveling
at 35 mph (56 kph) under windless conditions. A
headwind will slow one down by half its own speed. If
one normally rides 15 mph, and then steers into a 10
mph headwind, the resulting speed will be 10 mph.
Because of the significant increase in drag a rider
encounters as speed is increased, small adjustments
of bike and body contours can significantly alter
energy expenditures. These alterations can be to
clothing, frame design, handlebars, wheels (spokes),
rider profile, and the race strategy of drafting. Of the
two resistance factors, the rider and the bike, the rider
accounts for approximately 70 percent of the wind
resistance encountered, while the bicycle accounts
for only 30 percent. Unlike a sleek automobile, the
high upright bike and rider is a very inefficient aerodynamic
profile, so encircling a rider and bike fully or
partially in a streamlined fairing can drop the drag
coefficient by 0.25, resulting in a top speed increase
from 30 to 36 mph (48 to 58 kph). However, this gain
could be somewhat negated on hot days because of
the body overheating, or from instability caused by
gusty crosswinds.
Fully faired bicycles and faired adult tricycles are
today the stuff of cutting edge inventors and hobbyists.
Virtually all of them are recumbent bikes,
because it makes sense to start out with a smaller
frontal area to begin with. Some are reasonably practical
for daily use, with lights, radios and ventilation
systems; others are pure race machines.
Rolling Resistance
Rolling resistance is almost directly proportional
to the total weight on the tires. It is the sum of the
deformation of the wheel, tire, and road surface at the
point of contact. Energy loss occurs when the three
do not return all of the energy to the cycle.
Rolling resistance varies tremendously by tire.
Greater air pressure and less contact area is the reason
the rolling resistance that a tops of-the-line racing tire
encounters on smooth pavement is half or one-third
that of a heavily-knobbed mountain bike tire.
But unlike air resistance, rolling resistance varies
directly with speed, which means that as speed
increases, the rolling resistance factor becomes less
important relative to the air resistance. A bike going
20 mph has twice the rolling resistance of a bike
going 10 mph. If the bike has good-quality tires with
proper inflation pressure, neither rolling resistance
number is high enough to be particularly significant.
Rolling resistance declines with smoother and
harder road surfaces, larger diameter wheels, higher
tire pressures, smoother and thinner tread, and narrower
tires. In the case of rough, pot-holed roads,
energy is lost in bounce. For soft surfaces such as
gravel or sand, energy is robbed and absorbed by the
surface. Anyone who has ridden with severely underinflated
tires or through mud can attest to the
extremely wasteful loss of human energy.
Over rough surfaces, an opposite effect, not easily
measured in the laboratory, becomes apparent to the
rider. A tire inflated to very high pressures (for example,
120 pounds) bounces off the peaks of the road
surface, making the bike harder to control, and negating
any theoretical decrease in rolling resistance. For
that reason, top racers often use moderate inflation
pressures (85 to 90 pounds). Studies have found that
superinflatable tires (120 to 140 pounds) offer no
noticeable advantage over high-inflation tires because
they do not appreciably decrease rolling resistance.
Wheel size can have as dramatic an effect on
rolling resistance as tire inflation. On paper, a smaller
wheel size has more rolling resistance, a rougher
ride, and poorer handling over bumps than a larger
wheel size. Rolling resistance is inversely proportional
to the radius of the cylinder, that is, given the same
conditions, smaller-wheel bikes experience more
resistance to motion than larger-wheel bikes.
Fortunately for the makers of small-wheel folding
bikes, several factors can mitigate these shortcomings,
such as by using wider tires to compensate for
the smaller diameter. The use of improved modern
tire technology and the use of suspension in combination
with small wheels also help. In modern times,
the father of small-wheel suspension bikes, Alex
Moulton, began designing these bikes in the 1950s,
and his most recent designs have taken this bicycle
type to a new level. Hot on the heels of the Moulton
bicycle are bicycles such as Germany’s sophisticated
dual-suspension Birde. Many riders believe these
bikes completely negate the alleged disadvantages of
small-diameter wheels.
Pedal Cadence
Numerous physiological studies have addressed
the optimum pedal cadence, but these studies usually
miss the point because they focus on the seemingly
important factor of efficiency.
Efficiency is measured in power output per oxygen
consumed. However, the rider’s supply of oxygen is,
for all practical purposes, unlimited, and most riders
do not pedal at an effort level that leaves them constantly
breathless. Even if they did, they would not
want to follow the results of efficiency studies. These
studies consistently show that recreational cyclists
produce the best sustained performances (lowest
metabolic rate and highest efficiency) when the seat
is raised 4 or 5 centimeters above the normal height,
the pedal cranks are slightly longer to make it possible
to use higher gears, and the pedal cadence is in the
40 to 70 rpm range. However, experienced riders,
whether fast or slow, virtually always choose to ride
differently than the studies recommend.
Why? Efficiency does not matter if one has unlimited
oxygen. What does matter is long-term comfort.
Pedaling at the rate shown to be most efficient uses
up blood glucose the fastest. This leaves the rider
more susceptible to that sudden loss of energy known
as “the bonk,” and it also tends to leave more lactic
acid and other waste products in the muscles,
increasing discomfort and extending recovery time.
By contrast, pedaling faster (90 to 100 rpm) in a
lower gear at a lower effort level allows the body to
burn some fat along with the glucose, thereby
extending the glucose reserves. The more rapid leg
motion promotes blood circulation, the better to
remove waste products from the muscles. This faster
cadence is undeniably less efficient, because the body
uses energy just to spin the legs around, but it results
in increased long-term comfort.
Novice cyclists will often prefer the “more efficient”
slower cadence and higher saddle because this
configuration uses the leg muscles in a manner more
similar to the way walking uses those muscles. In addition,
the novice cyclist is often unable to benefit from
a higher pedal cadence because of an inability to apply
force perpendicular to the crank, resulting in excessive
body motion. A bike rider needs to gain some experience
with the “less efficient” faster cadence so his/her
muscles develop the coordination to function smoothly
in this new discipline. Having done that, the rider is
unlikely to go back to the slower, less efficient way.
Cleated shoes and toeclips are also advocated on
efficiency grounds. Every world-class cyclist uses toeclips
today because studies have shown significant
aerobic and anaerobic benefits. Toe clips often give
elite riders a false sense of power production during
the stroke recovery phase. Elite riders feel that toeclips
double their deliverable pedal power—a coordinated
push-pull effort, exerting an upward force, with the
trailing leg alongside the downward force of the forward
leg. In reality, however, the cadence is too fast to
create a pulling-up force. The importance of cleated
shoes and toe clips is in their ability to stabilize the
foot and more effectively generate a pushing force
rather than in generating a pulling force during the
recovery stage. Recreational cyclists benefit from this
foot stabilization as much as elite cyclists, do but
many of them are uncomfortable with toe clips.
Moreover, toe clips are undeniably clumsy in the frequent
start/stop environment of crowded city traffic.
Alternative Propulsion Systems
Throughout the history of the bicycle, inventors
have questioned whether the century-old circular
sprocket design is the most efficient. Many inventors
have built elliptical chainwheels, usually to have a
“higher gear” during the power stroke and a “lower
gear” during the dead spots at the very top and bottom
of the pedal stroke. Numerous studies show that
even elite riders are unable to apply propulsive force
to the pedals during these portions of the power
stroke, much as they are unable to lift on the backside
of the power stroke.
These elliptical chainwheels have never been widely
popular. Sophisticated cyclists tend to shun them
because cyclist develop a riding rhythm and a comfort
pattern from years of experience. Novices do not even
know they exist. Most bike designers fear that elliptical
chainwheels would tend to make novice cyclists
less inclined to develop a smooth pedaling style.
During the 1980s, Japan’s Shimano Corporation
invented a radically different alternative to round
chainwheels. The development of Shimano Biopace
chainwheels began with a very sophisticated study of
the biomechanical performance of bicyclists, and
Shimano discovered two flaws that it wanted to correct.
The first flaw was that the leg was speeding
downward as the foot approached the 6 o’clock (bottom)
position, and this downward momentum of the
leg mass was not being harnessed and converted into
forward motion. The second flaw occured during the
upstroke phase of the pedal path. Shimano discovered
that at this point in the pedal path, the knee joint was
switching from flexion to extension, and the switch
was so fast that both sets of muscles were being energized
at once—so that the body was fighting itself.
Shimano addressed the first problem with a design
that seemed counterintuitive. The chainwheel was
shaped so that the rider experienced the feeling of a
lower gear during the power stroke. Then, at the bottom
of the pedal stroke, the gear got higher, to absorb
the energy from the leg mass’s downward momentum
(see Figure 1). The second problem was
addressed by a change in the chainwheel shape,
which slowed down that portion of the pedal stroke,
giving the leg a few additional hundredths of a second
to switch between flexion and extension.
As good as Shimano’s research was, the product
bombed in the notoriously conservative bicycle marketplace,
and Biopace is history today. It’s doubtful
that bicycles will ever come with nonround chainwheels.
The round ones do too good a job, and are
too easy to make and market.
Lever propulsion—requiring an up-and-down
stair-climbing motion—is another propulsion system
long proposed, on efficiency grounds, as a replacement
for the standard pedal-and-crank system.
Though promising in theory, studies have shown
that the muscle efficiency for pedaling a chain wheel
is not inferior to that associated with stepping and
steep-grade walking. Lever systems maximize the
problem of harnessing the leg mass’s downward
momentum, and work against the smoothness that
experienced riders have come to enjoy so much.
There is no basis for the theory that only when
pushing the whole stroke vertically do the muscles
work efficiently, and that the backward-and-forward
foot movement over the top and bottom wastes energy.
Certainly, there is some efficiency loss, but it is
minimal. Toe clips and better variable gear systems
have further minimized “top-dead-center problems”
associated with the standard circular sprocket design.
THE BICYCLE AS TRANSPORTATION
Bicycles are the number-one mode of transportation
in the world. More than 100 million new bicycles
enter the market each year and, in Southeast Asia
alone, around 700 million bicycles are used daily as a
means of transportation.
China is the world’s biggest producer and user of
bicycles. Since 1985, China has been manufacturing
more than 30 million bicycles each year. In Shanghai,
more than 4 million people bicycle to work and
school every day. Bicycles far outnumber automobiles.
Whereas there is one automobile for every 1.7
people in the United States, in China there is only
about one automobile for every 680 people.
However, the developing nations seem determined
to become overdependent on the automobile as well.
In the quest for greater status and mobility, motorized
vehicles are quickly becoming the most soughtafter
possessions in Asia and other developing
nations. This pro-auto movement quickens with economic
growth that creates more capital to purchase
the vehicles. Paying for the energy to run the vehicle
is a much smaller concern. As a larger segment of the
Asian population rapidly becomes affluent and develops
an addiction to the automobile—similar to that is
the United States and other developed nations—
world petroleum consumption will soar. The U.S.
Department of Energy projects Asian transportation
petroleum demand will nearly triple from 1995 to
2020, going from 9.6 to 26 quadrillion Btu’s.
Although the bicycle is primarily used for recreation
in North America, some urban areas (e.g., San
Francisco, New York, and Toronto) are experiencing
an upswing in the number of workers commuting by
bicycle instead of car. Widespread use of bicycles for
commuting would have a profound effect on energy
supplies and society. If half of the U.S. labor force
biked to work instead of driving, the United States
could significantly curtail petroleum imports; moreover,
the exercise attained by pedaling to work could
shrink the obesity and overweight population, and
thereby dramatically improve the overall health of
many. Despite these benefits, a massive switch to
bicycling is highly unlikely for one major reason: It is
impractical. There are too many inconveniences
involved that are simply unacceptable to the majority
of an increasingly affluent population, particularly
when the alternative is a climate-controlled, highspeed
drive to work in a very comfortable automobile.
The primary inconvenience is the relative slowness
and lack of comfort, especially during days of
inclement weather. Many millions of Americans live
great distances from where they work. Some might
consider bicycling five miles to work each day, but
few live that near to work. The typical 20-or-30-mile
commute makes bicycling an unrealistic option for
most people. And for those who do live close to
work, few are willing to brave the elements to bicycle
year around. Rain, snow, ice, high winds, extreme
cold, and extreme heat that are minor inconveniences
in a vehicle become major inconveniences on a
bicycle. Thus, for backup, bicycle riders usually must
own a vehicle for bad weather days, or have access to
convenient mass transit.
By contrast, the bicycle survives as basic transportation
in the Netherlands and Germany because
those nations have a social infrastructure built to
make it possible. Those countries have a neighborhood-
centered way of life, and the trip distances on a
bicycle are often two or three kilometers or less.
People cycle slowly out of politeness to others on the
crowded streets. Public transit is also far better than
in the United States. It is amusing to see a German
commuter train station with virtually no auto parking
available, but hundreds of bike parking spots.
Intermodal commuting with a bicycle may someday
be a way around congested roadways. One of the
biggest problems facing mass transit developers is
trying to provide service to a sprawling, residential
community that needs to commute to equally decentralized
work sites. The majority of the population
resides a driving distance from mass transit stops, and
mass transit service ends too far from a work site to
make walking practical. If buses and trains were
equipped to carry bicycles, or folding bicycles gained
wider acceptance, the bicycle might someday serve as
the intermodal link. The bike could be pedaled to the
train, loaded for mass transit, and then pedaled the
final leg of the commute. It is uncertain whether this
alternative means of commuting will ever become
attractive enought to overcome the drawbacks of
weather, bicycle storage, and safety concerns.
Some people believe that bicyclists require dedicated
bike lanes and trails. This is a half-truth.
Certainly, these facilities are widespread in Germany
and the Netherlands, but they are far less common in
other cycling countries such as the United Kingdom,
France, and Cuba. In those countries, bicyclists have
long known that they can share the road with automobiles as long as all road users respect the same set
of rules.
Dedicated facilities are often cited for safety purposes,
but this, too, is not a simple truth. Most accidents
occur at intersections, and dedicated facilities
make intersections far more complex. When the
Netherlands allowed their moped riders to travel in
the auto lanes instead of the bike lanes, the moped
accident rate fell by an astounding 70 percent. The
bicycle accident rate would be higher if bicyclists
tried to ride at brisk speed in these separated bike
lanes. The sub-10-mph speeds that are considered
polite in these countries largely allow bicyclists to
compensate for the facilities’ shortcomings, at the
expense of travel time.
In the United States, advocates for bicycling are
divided on the question of special facilities. It is
doubtful that Dutch-style facilities would create
much greater ridership in most U.S. locales, because
the trip distances are too long. The best reading of
accident statistics shows that adult riders wellschooled
in sharing the road with automobiles and
respecting the same rules (“vehicular cycling”) have
about one-fifth the accident rate of a control group of
otherwise-well-educated adults.
Aside from the comfort and convenience disadvantages
of bicycling, perhaps the biggest obstacle is
the price of energy. Energy is far too cheap to make
pedal power worthwhile, except as a hobby. For most
people, the cost of the one or two gallons of gasoline
used commuting each day is paid for in less than 10
minutes of work time. Of course, the pedal power
equivalent of electrical energy is even less. To travel
at 15 mph (24 kph) on flat ground requires only
around 82 watts of power. If one ran on electrical
energy instead of food energy, the cost of the electricity
to generate that 82 watts to travel 14 miles to
work is about 0.7 cent.
Sweating is another problem. Few people want to
arrive at work with a sweat-soaked body. There are
usually no showers at work, and few want the additional
burden of lugging work clothes that would
need pressing on arrival. For most riders, sweating is
inevitable, particularly when climbing hills. The
human body is about one-third efficient in converting
the energy of glucose into muscle movement.
The other two-thirds is waste heat, and sweat is how
the body gets rid of excess heat.
Because of the desire to avoid perspiring, and the
limited energy available to propel a bicycle, there is
growing interest in electric motor-assisted bicycles
that can make that 15-mile commute to work a neareffortless
experience. The electric motor allows the
rider to maintain a reasonable speed without exerting
enough energy to perspire. The U.S. market saw at
least a dozen brands of electric-assist bicycle during
the 1990s. The more sophisticated offer regenerative
braking 15 to 20 miles of range, and recharging cost of
2 to 3 cents for a 15-mile distance (at 10 cents kWh).
These bikes could be a wonderful transportation
option, combining the efficiency, quiet and nonpollution
of a bicycle with the ease of riding a small
motorcycle. For these reasons, electric-assist bikes
sell at the rate of over 200,000 per year in Japan. But
in the United States, these bikes run up against a cultural
barrier. Bicycle enthusiasts, who are less likely
to object to their four-figure price tags, do not want a
motor and do not want a bike that weighs 60 pounds.
Others do not want to be seen riding to work. So
U.S. sales have been poor.
As the number of motor scooters and motorcycles
in Asia has grown at an alarming rate, policies to
encourage the use of electricity-assisted bicycles are
seriously being considered as a way to curtail vehicle
emissions. In Bangkok, Thailand alone, over one million
people needed treatment for smog-related respiratory
problems in 1990. Greater affluence and the
demand for faster transportation in China have resulted
in yearly sales of motorcycles increasing from less
than half a million sold in 1991 to over 10 million by
1996, further contributing to air pollution that is
already some of the worst in the world. Unless zeroemission
transportation, such as electric bicycles,
gains in popularity, the number and severity of smogrelated
respiratory problems are certain to worsen in
the most densely populated urban areas of Asia.
