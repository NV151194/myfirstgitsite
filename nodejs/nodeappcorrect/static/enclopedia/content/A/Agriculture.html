AGRICULTURE
The earliest human inhabitants of the earth were
hunters and gatherers. Under favorable conditions
they required at least 1.5 square kilometers to provide
food for one person, and in harsher environments as
much as 80 to 100 square kilometers. Population
pressure eventually led humans to raise plants and
animals.
With the introduction of agriculture, humans
began to use energy to control the growth of plants
and animals, to make more efficient use of the solar
energy stored in plants by photosynthesis. However,
for many thousands of years, the only energy used for
this purpose was human energy. The energy drawn
from the biosphere was limited to the dietary energy
provided by plant food and meat, and to the use of
wood and grasses as fuel for heating and cooking.
Later, humans learned to use animal, water, and wind
energy to obtain power for transport and for simple
agricultural and industrial processes. As population
grew, the use of energy increased steadily, but all of it
came from renewable resources.
Shifting cultivation, one of the first agricultural
practices developed, is still widely used. In the early
1970s, about 36 million square kilometers of land
were farmed under this system, producing food for
about 250 million people. Each hectare (2.47 acres or
10,000 square meters) under shifting cultivation can
provide adequate food for one person. Degradation
of soil and vegetation usually occurs when the population
density exceeds one person per four hectares.
At higher population densities, shorter fallow periods
and eventually annual cropping become necessary.
Annual cropping by traditional methods requires
more labor, and yields are generally lower. Although
animal power can help reduce human labor and provide
manure for fertilizer, draught animals must be
either fed by some of the crop or pastured, thereby
increasing the land area required per person unless
yields per unit of land increase accordingly. Average
livestock ate one-fourth of the yield in the early nineteenth
century.
This land per person dynamic has changed in the
past one hundred years as humans moved beyond the
limitations of human and animal power by drawing
upon nonrenewable sources of energy in the form of
fossil fuels—coal, oil, and natural gas. Rapid
improvements in technology made it possible to
locate and extract increasing quantities of fossil fuels
with little or no increase in cost. By the 1950s and
1960s the world had come to take advantage of the
large supply of fossil fuels to dramatically and economically
boost agricultural production.
Energy dense fossil fuels can be converted very
efficiently to heat and/or power. Use of energy for
power has spread rapidly in both the industrial and
agricultural sectors of the developed countries. The
developing countries have followed the developed
countries along the same path but at a slower pace.
Although agriculture uses only a small share of the
world’s total energy consumption, it is generally recognized
that its needs are crucial, because the existing
technologies for increasing production rely so heavily
on energy-intensive inputs. Farm use of energy
accounts for only 4 percent of total commercial energy
use in developing countries and 3 percent in the
developed countries. Commercial energy includes oil,
natural gas, and coal. Noncommercial sources of
energy include fuel-wood, plant and animal residues,
and human and animal energy. Noncommercial energy
uses are very important in the developing countries,
especially in rural areas.
There is a two-way relationship between agriculture
and energy because agriculture is both a consumer
and a producer of energy. Directly or
indirectly, the whole agricultural process involves the
input of energy. The ability of plants to capture and
store the sun’s energy through photosynthesis can be
increased through the input of energy in the form of
fertilizer, pesticides, and fuel to drive machinery used
in production. The production of nitrogen fertilizers
is very energy intensive input because it requires
hydrogen-dissociation from water or fossil fuels (natural
gas) to fix nitrogen in synthetic fertilizers.
Production of pesticides similar to nitrogen fertilizers
requires large amounts of energy. The gasoline and
diesel fuel used for agricultural machinery also consumes
a lot of energy, but has dropped significantly
since the early 1970s because of better technology.
The role of energy in agricultural production has
become crucial as population and income growth put
pressure on the demand for food. By discovering new
technologies (hybrid seeds, drought and diseaseresistant
crops, as well as genetically modified crops),
dramatic increases in crop yields per hectare have
been achieved in the developed countries. The pace
of growth, however, has been uneven among developing
countries. Asia has shown significant increases
in agricultural productivity, while many countries in
Africa and Latin America have had modest productivity
growth. Although many developing countries
have reserves of unused but potentially productive
land, most have to meet rising food demands by substantially
raising yields on both used and new land.
The growth in yields does not come automatically.
An increase in agricultural research investment is
essential both to increase the yield and to expand the
area under cultivation. Clearing less accessible new
land for cultivation, which is the goal of many environmentalist
groups, will require greater investment
in inputs of commercial energy and often the provision
of drainage, irrigation, and soil conservation systems.
Once the land is under production, additional
energy will be needed for maintenance.
CLASSIFICATION OF
AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION
World production of food and fiber could be classified
into three distinct groups: traditional, transition from
traditional to modern, and modern farming methods.
Traditional Agriculture
Traditional farms rely on labor, draught animals,
and hand tools. The only commercial energy input in
traditional farming is that required to produce hand
tools and animal implements. No commercial energy
inputs are used for irrigation; the land either gets rain
or it’s irrigated by traditional methods.
Traditional methods continue to be the mode of
operation in many parts of the world. Currently agriculture
production in many of the lowest income
countries in Africa, Latin America, and Asia are based
on traditional methods. Agriculture is largely operated
by small family farms using human and animal power
and organic fertilizer with little access to or knowledge
of modern inputs such as chemicals, fertilizers, hybrid
seeds, or mechanical drive. Low soil fertility and inadequate
or irregular rainfall sharply limit the productivity
of low-input farms in developing countries.
The Transition to Modern Farming
In the transition to modern farming methods, the
use of commercial energy, especially machinery and
fertilizer, increases sharply. Primary tillage is usually
one of the first operations to be mechanized, requiring
an increase in commercial energy use not only for
the production of farm machinery, but also for its
operation. Improved crop varieties are often introduced
during the transitional phase, requiring commercial
energy for their production and distribution.
To help realize their yield potential entails the use of
chemical fertilizers and pesticides. Both of these
inputs require commercial energy for their manufacture.
In addition to the traditional irrigation methods,
supplementary irrigation with mechanically powered
pumps is often introduced during the transitional
phase. This process substantially increases commercial
energy requirements but also increases yields.
The growing needs for investment during transition
influence farm size. To achieve economies of scale,
the number of family farms is reduced and they are
replaced with larger commercial farms.
This general trend toward larger farms, greater
mechanization, and greater use of commercial inputs
in most countries results in greater productivity but
at the cost of greater direct and indirect energy use.
The combination of increased irrigation, use of high
yield variety crops, and new inputs has contributed to
steady increases in both absolute and percapita agricultural
production.
Modern Commercial Agriculture
To feed the growing population, agricultural productivity
must increase. Modern inputs are needed to
increase agricultural production. Commercial fuel
inputs to agriculture include mechanized land preparation,
mechanized irrigation, and synthetic fertilizer.
Modern commercial agriculture is greatly dependent
on high yielding varieties, and modern pesticides.
The degree of utilization of the above inputs varies
widely, but generally increases with economic development.
These modern technologies reduce the time
and labor needed for land preparation, plowing,
planting, and harvesting crops. In favorable areas, it
also aids double cropping management.
In the developed countries, stages in the historical
development of agricultural production have been
characterized by differing combinations of inputs:
differences in relative proportion of land, labor and
capital, and in the composition of the capital inputs.
Such changes reflect primarily the changing structure
of the economy and the successive advances that have
been made in agricultural technology.
The well-documented case of the United States
serves as an illustration. During the period 1870 to
1900 the farm population was increased through a
rapid expansion of the agricultural area. The agricultural
labor force increased by 60 percent, but there
was a replacement of labor by nonland capital in the
form of horses and mules. New and more efficient
types of horse-drawn machinery including plows,
cultivars, seed drills, grain harvesters, and mowers
became available.
The following period, from 1900 to 1930, was a
period of transition: the first half was the beginning
of the end for traditional farming, based predominantly
on large inputs of relatively unskilled labor,
and the second half the beginning of commercial
agriculture, technologically oriented and capital
intensive. The crop-land use continued to increase
until about 1920 but remained relatively stable thereafter,
and the agricultural labor force continued to
increase until about 1918. Equally significant, however,
were the shifts that became evident in the composition
of non-real-estate capital input: the
replacement of horses and mules by tractors, automobiles
and trucks; of manpower by motor-driven
machinery and equipment; and the purchase of production
inputs such as fertilizer, lime, seed, and feed
required for the application of improved production
techniques.
Between 1935 and 1960 outputs per man-hour of
labor increased about 4.5 times, and crop production
per hectare of crop-land almost doubled. Inputs of
labor were decreased by 50 percent, inputs of land
remained relatively stable, but inputs of non-real-estate
capital inputs were nearly tripled. Among these capital
inputs, those of seed, feed, and livestock purchased
increased by about four times, and those of mechanical
power and machinery by more than 2.5 times.
It has been estimated that of the total U.S.
increase in farm output between 1940 and 1955, 43
percent is attributable to increased crop yields per
hectare, 27 percent to increases in value added by
livestock production, 23 percent to reduction in
farm-produced power, and 7 percent to changes in
the amount of capital used. While it is not possible
to isolate the effect of a single input, it is estimated
that increased use of fertilizer accounted for more
than half of the increase in crop production per
hectare. Other important causes of increased crop
yields include the use of hybrid maize and other
improved plant varieties, irrigation, better soil
tillage practices, more timely planning, cultivation
and harvesting operations, and better weed, insect,
and disease control.
ENERGY USE IN TRADITIONAL AND
MODERN AGRICULTURE
Commercial energy plays a major role in modern
methods of production. Energy use even with modern
methods varies by crop. Crops requiring irrigation
use much more energy than rain-fed crops.
About 42 percent of total energy is used for irrigation,
20 percent for the manufacture and operation of farm
machinery, 18 percent for fertilizers, and 7 percent
for drying. For modern rice production in the United
States, the commercial energy input is more than 500
times that in traditional production and more than 10
times in transitional production in the Philippines.
For modern corn production in the United States,
total commercial energy use is only about half that in
modern rice production, mainly because little or no
irrigation is required. Regardless of the crop produced,
energy use is much higher with modern production
method. For example, commercial energy
input in the United States is more than 174 times that
in traditional production in the Mexico.
With modern production methods 1500 kilograms
of petroleum per hectare are needed for rice and 700
kilograms for maize. However, with this commercial
energy use, yields of 5.8 metric tons per hectare have
been obtained for rice and 5 metric tons per hectare
for maize—about five times those obtained with traditional
methods, Thus, 20 to 25 people can be fed on
an all-grain diet from a single hectare compared with
4 to 6 people by traditional methods.
Total energy used to produce a kilogram of rice on
Philippine traditional farms requires three grams of
petroleum and in transitional farms 55 grams. In the
U.S. modern rice farming system the requirement
increases to 258 grams of petroleum. Similarly, the
ratio for corn production in Mexico for traditional
farming is equal to four grams of petroleum, and for
modern corn farming in the United States is equal to
137 grams of petroleum.
Despite higher dependence on energy in modern
methods of production, agriculture is responsible for
only a small part of total energy use. Total energy use
as well as energy used in agricultural production in
selected developing and developed countries and for
the largest food producers in the world; the United
States and China are compared in Table 1. In 1996,
agricultural shares of energy use for all developed
countries were 2 percent, whereas in the developing
countries the proportion was slightly higher.
Agricultural shares of total commercial energy use in
the developing countries ranged from 0.67 percent in
Egypt to 5.08 percent in Brazil. For the developed
countries agricultural share of energy ranged from
1.09 percent in the United States to 3.39 percent for
the European Community.
COMMERCIAL ENERGY USE
IN AGRICULTURE
Agriculture uses a variety of commercial energy
forms, directly for operating machinery and equipment
on the farm and indirectly through the use of
fertilizer and pesticides produced off the farm. In
addition, commercial energy is used in manufacturing
of farm machinery and farm equipment. During
1972 to 1973 farm machinery manufacture and operation,
the largest user of commercial energy in agriculture,
accounted for 51 percent of the world total
and ranged from 8 percent in the Far East to 73 percent
in Oceania. Chemical fertilizer was second with
45 percent of the world total and ranged from 26 percent
in Oceania to 84 percent in the Far East.
However, in the developing countries chemical fertilizer
was first.
About 1.5 billion hectares of crop land are planted
for annual crops and permanent crops. About one
third of the arable and permenant crop-land is located
in the United States, India, and China. Out of 1.5
billion hectares, 263 million hectares are irrigated.
Irrigated lands in China and India account for the
largest share—about 110 million hectares.
Reports by the International Energy Agency indicate
that total renewable energy use in developing
countries and in agriculture is high, but no data is
available. The available data on selected countries
shows that the use of renewable energy in developing
countries varies from 5 percent in Egypt to 86 percent
in Nigeria. Energy share of the renewable energy in
the developed countries ranged from 1 percent in
Japan to 6 percent in Australia.
To measure the efficiency of energy use in agriculture,energy use in agriculture is compared with
agriculture’s share of gross domestic products
(GDP). For many developing countries, the share of
agricultural GDP is much larger than the share of
energy used in agriculture, which suggests that much
of the agricultural sector is still engaged in subsistence,
low input, labor-intensive farming. For some
middle income countries such as Brazil, Egypt, and
Indonesia the two ratios are in better balance.
Developed countries have a very close balance
between agriculture’s share of GDP and share of
energy use in agriculture. Energy use share is lower
than agricultural GDP share except for Japan and the
European Union which both rely heavily on intensive
production methods.
Energy use per hectare of arable and permanent
crop-land can be used as an indicator of the efficiency
of energy use in agriculture, although definite conclusions
from this indicator are hard to draw unless countries
with the same scale of operations are compared.
Low energy use per hectare can reflect low-input, lowyield
agriculture, which is the case for some developing
countries such as Bangladesh, India, Indonesia,
Nigeria, and Pakistan. On the other hand, low energy
use (dry-land farming with less fertilizer and pesticide
use) per hectare can also indicate the extensive farming
practices of countries such as Australia and Canada
where low yield relative to high-input use countries
have not prevented these countries from being competitive
agricultural exporters. Japan and the European
Union stand out as being very high energy users relative
to their land base. The United States has a relaeoe
tively low energy use per hectare, especially when
compared to the European countries.
INPUT USE
Land Use and Irrigated Area
Using data from the United Nations Food and
Agriculture Organization (FAO) for arable and permanent
crop-land for 1966 to 1996, developing
countries have experienced the most significant
growth in land area. The highest growth was realized
in Brazil, China, and India. In contrast, most developed
countries have experienced a decline in arable
and permanent crop-land, with Australia and Canada
being the exceptions. For some developing countries,
such as Egypt and India, increases in area as well as
yields have been important in increasing output. For
developed countries, increases in output have been a
function of higher yields rather than increases in area.
The U.S. agricultural area increased more than 12
million hectares during the 1970s and 1980s and
declined in the 1990s, with an overall decline of onehalf
million hectares.
Irrigated areas increased in the last three decades in
all countries except Japan. Growth has been rapid in
Bangladesh and Brazil. Growth in irrigated areas in
the United States has been among the slowest of the
selected developed countries. The share of agricultural
area under irrigation varies considerably, reflecting
resource endowments and crop composition. In 1996,
Egypt had 100 percent of its area under irrigation, followed
by Pakistan with 81 percent and Japan with 63
percent. More than a third of land is irrigated in
China, India, and Bangladesh. Canada, Australia, and
the United States, with large-scale, extensive farming
practices, have lower shares of irrigated areas.
Fertilizer Use
Fertilizer use (measured in tons of active ingredients)
has increased most rapidly in developing countries,
where yields generally lagged behind those in
developed. Among developed countries, fertilizer use
per hectare is very high in Japan and the European
countries. Fertilizer use is also high in some of the
developing countries, including Egypt, China,
Bangladesh, and Pakistan. Fertilizer use in the
United States is low compared to the European
countries, as is true for other large crop producers
such as Canada, Australia, and Brazil.
Pesticide Use
Data on pesticide use, including insecticides, herbicides,
fungicides, and other chemicals is scarce.
Similar to fertilizer use, pesticide use is the highest in
the United States followed by the European countries,
and Australia. Pesticide use per hectare is much
higher than in other developed countries because
farmers are trying to maximize the yield per hectare.
Among developing countries pesticide use is also
high in Egypt, Brazil, and Pakistan. The trend in
developing countries is for more use of chemicals in
agriculture to increase yield per hectare.
Machinery Use
Machinery use has followed a similar pattern to
fertilizer use, with the largest increases occurring in
developing countries and smaller increases or
declines in developed countries. The data do not
reflect changes in quality or complexity of agricultural
machinery. The relative intensity of use is highest
in Japan followed by the European countries.
Machinery use in the United States is much lower
than in Europe and has remained steady because the
average farm is much larger in the United States,
which translates into better utilization of farm equipment.
Machinery use increased in all developing
countries. Growth has been rapid in Pakistan,
Indonesia, and India, followed by Japan. In the developing
countries, machinery use per hectare is lowest
in Bangladesh and highest in Egypt.
