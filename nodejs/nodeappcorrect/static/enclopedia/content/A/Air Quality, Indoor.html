AIR QUALITY, INDOOR
While most of us are aware of the dangers posed by
outdoor air pollution, awareness of airborne chemical
and biological pollutants present indoors and its
implications for human health is more limited. Some
indoor air gases and pollutants such as radon, asbestos,
carbon monoxide, biological contaminants, and
volatile organic compounds (VOCs) pose a serious
threat to our health and well-being. Over the past several
decades, our exposure to indoor air pollutants is
believed to have increased due to a variety of factors,
including the construction of more tightly sealed
buildings; reduced ventilation rates to save energy;
use of synthetic building materials and furnishings;
and use of chemically formulated personal care products,
pesticides, and household cleaners. Since an
average person spends increasing amount of time
indoors, it is important to understand the health risks
posed by prolonged exposure to indoor pollutants and
the energy and comfort implications of different
methods to control and mitigate these pollutants in
order to ensure acceptable indoor air quality.
Acceptable indoor air quality (IAQ) is defined as
“air in which there are no known contaminants at
harmful concentrations as determined by cognizant
authorities and with which a substantial majority
(80%) of the people exposed do not express dissatisfaction”
(ASHRAE, 1989). Some of these indoor air
contaminants are particulates, vapors, and gases that
may be generated by occupants and their activities,
building materials, furniture, equipment and appliances
present in indoor space, operations and maintenance
activities, or brought in from outside.
Examples of indoor pollutants are certain gases
(radon, carbon monoxide, and carbon dioxide),
volatile organic compounds or VOCs (environmental
tobacco smoke, formaldehyde, solvents, and fragrances,
etc.), bioaerosols (mold spores, pollen,
bacteria, animal dander, etc.), and particles from
buildings, furnishings and occupants (fiberglass,
paper dust, lint from clothing, carpet fibers, etc.).
As the science of indoor air quality has matured,
indoor air professionals have realized that many
indoor air contaminants and the associated health
effects are linked to specific types of buildings and
their characteristics. For example, radon is primarily
an indoor air concern in homes because of the ease
with which it can be transported inside residential
construction from the soil beneath. On the other
hand, Sick Building Syndrome (SBS) primarily
afflicts office building occupants who experience
acute health and comfort effects that appear to be
linked to time spent in a specific building.
It has been estimated that hundreds of billions of
dollars per year is lost due to decreased workplace
productivity and increased health costs that can be
saved by maintaining good indoor air quality in commercial
buildings. The financial benefits of improving
IAQ can accrue from reducing costs for health
care and sick leave, as well as the costs of performance
decrements at work caused by illness or adverse
health symptoms and of responding to occupant
complaints and costs of IAQ investigations.
Indoor air quality problems have grown with the
increased use of heating, ventilating, and air-conditioning
(HVAC) systems in commercial and residential
buildings. Greater use of HVAC systems have
also resulted in the closer examination of the energy
impacts of maintaining good indoor air quality. The
trade-off between reducing heating and cooling loads
of the HVAC system by recirculating as much indoor
air as possible and providing an optimum amount of
fresh outdoor air forms the underpinnings of many
IAQ standards and guidelines in climate-controlled
commercial buildings.
HVAC SYSTEM
A wide variety of HVAC systems are used in residential
and commercial buildings to thermally condition
and ventilate the occupied spaces. While HVAC syseoe
tems can provide enhanced levels of thermal comfort
in very hot or very cold weather conditions, thermodynamic
processes required to condition outdoor air
and deliver conditioned air to occupied spaces to
maintain indoor comfort conditions are fairly energy
intensive.
A typical HVAC system uses a combination of heating,
cooling, humidification (adding moisture) and
dehumidification (removing moisture) processes to
thermally condition air. This conditioned air, which is
a mixture of outdoor air and recirculated indoor air, is
known as supply air. The supply airstream typically
passes through filters, heat exchangers that add or
remove heat from the supply airstream, a supply fan,
air ducts, dampers that are used to regulate the rate of
airflow, and finally diffusers located either in the ceiling
or floor to the occupied space. The return air is
drawn from the occupied spaces and flows back to the
mechanical rooms either through return air ducts or
through the plenum between suspended ceiling and
the floor of the next-higher story. A portion of the
return air is exhausted to the outdoors, and the
remainder is mixed with the fresh outdoor air and resupplied
to the space after filtering and thermal conditioning.
In general, the supply air contains more
recirculated air than fresh outdoor air to keep the energy
cost of air conditioning down.
In an all-air system, the indoor temperature can be
controlled either by a constant air volume (CAV) system,
which varies the temperature of the air but
keeps the volume constant, or by a variable air volume
(VAV) system, which maintains a constant temperature
and varies the volume of the air supplied to
internal spaces.
To save energy, many HVAC systems employ a
mechanism for regulating the flow of outdoor air
called an economizer cycle. An economizer cycle
takes advantage of milder outdoor conditions to
increase the outside air intake and in the process
reduces the cooling load on the system. Controlling
the rate of flow of outdoor air appears simple, in theory,
but often works poorly in practice. The small
pressure drop required to control the flow rate of
outdoor air is rarely controlled and monitored. Quite
often, the damper system used to regulate the airflow
is nonfunctional, disconnected from the damper
actuators, or casually adjusted by building operators
(Institute of Medicine, 2000).
Outdoor airflow concerns are some of the many
reasons that make maintaining good indoor air quality
in a controlled indoor environment a particularly
challenging task. Maintaining a safe, comfortable
indoor environment for workers and residents is
challenging under the best of circumstances because
apart from temperature control, HVAC systems are
also responsible for moisture control and ventilation
of buildings. Hot, humid climates, in particular, present
some of the biggest challenges, and solutions that
are tested and proven in temperate climates may
actually worsen IAQ problems in hot, humid climates
(Odom and DuBose, 1991).
INDOOR AIR POLLUTANTS: GENERATION,
MITIGATION, AND EXPOSURE
To maintain acceptable indoor air quality, the concentration
of pollutants known to degrade indoor air
quality and affect human health must be controlled.
If the origin of the contaminant is known, it is more
effective to exercise source control over any mitigation
strategy. If the origin of the contaminants is not
known, building ventilation and air cleaning and filtration
are the two most commonly used processes to
dilute or remove all types of contaminants from the
indoor air and maintain acceptable indoor environmental
conditions.
Source Control
Source control is one of the most important methods
to achieve healthy indoor air. Methods vary
depending on the pollutants and can range from simple
solutions (not using pressed wood furniture that
use formaldehyde) to complex and costly solutions
(identifying moisture infiltration through the building
envelope). Source control may also require behavioral
changes on the part of the affected population, a
remedy that may be achieved either through environmental
regulation or by raising public awareness. A
case in point is the changing perception toward environmental
tobacco smoke (ETS). Banning smoking
in public spaces or discouraging smoking in homes
and in front of children can reduce the risks of second
hand smoke greatly. Other examples are selecting furniture
that doesn’t contain formaldehyde and using
paints and carpets that don’t emit chemicals that are
known to degrade indoor air. If the air contaminants
are being transported inside from outdoor sources,
precautions should be taken to either plug the pathway
to stop such transport (e.g., sealing the construction
joints and cracks in the basement to reduce radon
infiltration) or take steps to minimize the infiltration
of contaminants (e.g., positioning the fresh air intake
away from loading docks and parking spaces).
For radon, moisture, ETS, asbestos, lead-based
paint, building materials and products that emit
VOCs, pesticides, and household products, one can
develop effective source control strategy as well. For
example, assuring building envelope integrity at the
time of construction of the building would help control
and restrict the airflow into the building. The
envelope (walls, roof, floor or slab system) should
also control moisture infiltration by installing a continuous
vapor barrier on the warm side of the insulation
system. Operating the building at a slight
positive pressure can also help in keeping the moisture
outdoors. All these precautions can help control
the growth of mold and mildew that thrive under
moist conditions and can adversely affect the health
of building occupants.
Ventilation
In addition to minimizing the emissions of pollutants
from indoor sources, ventilation with outside
air must be provided at an adequate rate to maintain
acceptable IAQ. The ventilation rate—the rate of
outside air supply—is usually defined per unit of
floor area (liters per second per sq. meter), number of
occupants (liters per person), or indoor air volume
(air changes per hour). For indoor-generated particles,
the effects of ventilation rate is highly dependent
on particle size because the depositional losses of particles
increases dramatically with particle size. The
predicted change in pollutant concentrations with
ventilation rate is greatest for an “ideal” gaseous pollutant
that is not removed by deposition or sorption
on surfaces (Institute of Medicine, 2000). Ventilation
rate may have a very significant indirect impact on
indoor concentrations of some pollutants because
they affect indoor humidities, which in turn modify
indoor pollutant sources.
Buildings are ventilated mechanically with the
HVAC systems where it is a controlled process, as
well as via air infiltration and through the openable
windows and doors where it is largely an uncontrolled
process. However, as discussed earlier,
mechanical ventilation is one of the most energyintensive
methods of reducing indoor pollutant concentrations
primarily because of the need to
thermally condition air before it can be circulated
inside the occupied spaces. It is estimated that the
ventilation needs are responsible for consuming 10
percent of all the energy consumed in buildings in
developed countries.
On average, buildings with air conditioning that
have inadequate supply of fresh air are far more likely
to suffer from poor indoor air quality than naturally
ventilated buildings. On the other hand, one can
find serious IAQ problems in homes and apartment
buildings that are naturally ventilated as well.
There are two commonly used techniques to control
odors and contaminants. Both depend on ventilation
to achieve their goals. One of them relies on
the concept of “ventilation effectiveness,” which is
defined as the ability of the ventilation system to distribute
supply air and dilute internally generated pollutants
by ensuring a consistent and appropriate flow
of supply air that mixes effectively with room air.
The second technique isolates odors and contaminants
by maintaining proper pressure relationship
between outdoors and indoors and between different
indoor spaces. This is accomplished by adjusting the
air quantities that are supplied to and removed from
each room. In many large commercial buildings, particularly
in warm humid climates, the design intent is
to pressurize the building slightly with the mechanical
ventilation system in order to prevent undesirable
infiltration of unconditioned air, moisture, and outdoor
air pollutants. On the other hand, smoking
rooms, bathrooms, and laboratories are often depressurized
so that pollutants generated within these
rooms do not leak into the surrounding rooms.
Often, local dedicated exhaust ventilation is used
in rooms with high pollutant or odor sources as it is
more efficient in controlling indoor pollutant concentrations
than general ventilation of the entire
space (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 1991;
U.S. Department of Energy, 1998). In practice, however,
indoor-outdoor pressure differences are often
poorly controlled, and many buildings are not pressurized
(Persily and Norford, 1987). There is considerable
uncertainty in predicting the rate of dilution of
indoor contaminants in actual complex indoor environment,
with rates of pollutant loss by deposition on
indoor surfaces being one of the largest sources of
uncertainty.
Air Cleaning and Filtration
Particle air cleaning is any process that is used
intentionally to remove particles from the indoor air.
Filtration and electronic air cleaning are the two most
common examples. Typically, portable air cleaning
devices are used in rooms, while in typical commercial
HVAC systems the filter is placed upstream of
many of the HVAC components in the path of supply
airstream to filter particles. Two facts that are
applicable to both air cleaners and filters are
• Efficiency of any air cleaner or filter is a function of
the particle size present in the indoor air and the
velocity and volume of air flowing through the
device.
• Pressure drop is a concern wherever filters and, to a
lesser extent, air cleaners are employed in the path of
normal forced ventilation system.
The technologies for removing particles include
mechanical filters; electrostatic precipitators, which
charge particles and then collect them onto a surface
with the opposite charge; and ion generators, which
charge particles and thereby facilitate their deposition.
Among mechanical filters, high efficiency particulate
air (HEPA) filters are highly efficient in
removing particles of a wide range of sizes. However,
there is little evidence of either direct health benefits
or reduced concentration of pollutants resulting from
air cleaning or filtration applications (American
Thoracic Society, 1997). New stricter standards that
also allow filter selection based on offending contaminants
and their particle sizes found in buildings are
more likely to show direct health benefits.
Table 1 describes some of the common indoor air
pollutants found in buildings, their sources, and their
adverse health effects on human beings.
INDOOR AIR QUALITY AND ENERGY
Energy conservation measures instituted following
the energy crisis of 1974 resulted in the elimination
of openable windows and in the recycling of as much
air as possible to avoid heating or cooling outside air.
The amount of outdoor air considered adequate for
proper ventilation has varied substantially over time.
The current guideline, widely followed in the United
States, was issued by ASHRAE in 1989. To achieve
good IAQ in all-air systems, large but finite amount
of fresh air needs to be brought in, heated or cooled
depending on the climate and season, and distributed
to various parts of the building. The energy implications
are obviously huge because the temperature and
humidity of the supply air stream must be maintained
within a very narrow range to satisfy the thermal
comfort requirements of the building’s occupants.
Furthermore, temperature and humidity are
among the many factors that affect indoor contaminant
levels. Quality design, installation, and testing
and balancing with pressure relationship checks are
critically important for the proper operation of all
types of HVAC systems and for maintaining good
IAQ (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 1991;
ASHRAE, 1989).
Energy professionals and equipment manufacturers
are more cognizant of the indoor air problems and are
coming out with new products and strategies that
reduce energy use without degrading indoor air quality.
According to the U.S. Department of Energy
(1998), some of these energy efficient technologies can
be used to improve the existing IAQ inside buildings:
Using outdoor air economizer for free cooling—
An air “economizer” brings in outside air for air
conditioning a commercial building. This strategy
is particularly effective in mild weather
where the temperature and humidity content of
outside air is suitable for increasing the rate of
outside air supply above the minimum setpoint.
Generally, IAQ will improve due to the increase
in average ventilation rate. Care must be exercised
in using the economizer cycle in regions
where outdoor air is of suspect quality. Also, in
very humid regions, one must employ enthalpybased
control systems to take advantages of free
cooling with the economizer cycle without
encountering mold and mildew problems.
Heat recovery from exhaust air—If a heat recovery
system allows an increase in the rate of outside
air supply, IAQ will usually be improved.
Proper precautions must be taken to ensure that
moisture and contaminants from the exhaust air
stream are not transferred to the incoming air
stream. An innovative way of recovering heat
and reducing the dehumidification cost is to use
the waste heat to recharge the desiccant wheels
that are then used to remove moisture from the
supply air. In this method, the energy savings
have to be substantial to offset the high cost of
the desiccant wheels.
Nighttime pre-cooling using outdoor air—
Nighttime ventilation may result in decreased
indoor concentrations of indoor-generated pollutants
when occupants arrive at work. Once
again, proper precautions must be taken to
ensure that outdoor air with the right level of
moisture content is used for this purpose, otherwise
condensation on heating, ventilation,
and air conditioning equipment or building
components may result, increasing the risk of
growth of microorganisms.
Using radiant heating/cooling systems—Because
of the higher thermal capacity of water compared
to air, water is a better heat transfer medium.
In hydronic climate conditioning systems,
heat exchangers transmit heat from water to
indoor environment, or vice-versa. These heat
exchangers can either be convectors or radiators
depending on the primary heat transfer process.
The decoupling of ventilation from heating and
cooling can save energy and improve IAQ.
However, one must take appropriate measures
to avoid condensation problems.
CONCLUSIONS
Research done by experts in the field as well as in laboratories
has helped them understand the relationship
between IAQ, ventilation, and energy. More research
is needed to link specific health symptoms with exposure
to specific or a group of pollutants. The policy
challenge will be to raise awareness of indoor air quality
so that healthy, comfortable environments can be
provided by energy efficient technology.
