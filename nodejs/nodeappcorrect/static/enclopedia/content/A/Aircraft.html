AIRCRAFT
Today the airplane is part of everyday life, whether we
see one gracefully winging overhead, fly in one, or
receive someone or something (package, letter, etc.)
that was delivered by one. The invention and develop-
First flight of the Wright Flyer, December 17, 1903. (Library of Congress)
ment of the airplane is arguably one of the three most
important technical developments of the twentieth
century—the other two being the electronics revolution
and the unleashing of the power of the atom.
The first practical airplane was invented by Orville
and Wilbur Wright, two bicycle shop proprietors
from Dayton, Ohio. On December 17, 1903, the
Wright Flyer lifted from the sand of Kill Devil Hill
near Kitty Hawk, North Carolina, and with Orville at
the controls, flew a distance of 120 ft above the
ground, staying in the air for 12 sec. It was the first
successful, sustained flight of a heavier-than-air
piloted airplane. The photograph of the Flyer as it is
lifting off the ground, with Wilbur running alongside
to keep the right wing tip from digging into the sand,
is the most famous photograph in the annals of the
history of aeronautics. There were three more flights
that morning, the last one covering a distance of 852
ft above the ground, and remaining in the air for 59
sec. At that moment, the Wright brothers knew they
had accomplished something important—a feat
aspired to by many before them, but heretofore never
achieved. But they had no way of knowing the
tremendous extent to which their invention was to
dominate the course of events in the twentieth century—
technically, socially, and politically.
The history of the technical development of the
airplane can be divided into four eras: pre-Wright;
the strut-and-wire biplane; the mature propellerdriven
airplane, and the jet-propelled airplane. We
will organize our discussion in this article around
these four eras.
THE PRE-WRIGHT ERA
Before the Wright brothers’ first successful flight,
there were plenty of attempts by others. Indeed, the
Wrights did not invent the first airplane. They inherited
a bulk of aeronautical data and experience
achieved by numerous would-be inventors of the airplanes
over the previous centuries. In many respects,
when the Wright brothers began to work on the
invention of the practical airplane, they were standing
on the shoulders of giants before them.
From where and whom did the idea of the modern
configuration airplane come? The modern configuration
that we take for granted today is a flying
machine with fixed wings, a fuselage, and a tail, with
a separate mechanism for propulsion. This concept
was first pioneered by Sir George Cayley in England
in 1799. Cayley is responsible for conceiving and
advancing the basic idea that the mechanisms for lift
and thrust should be separated, with fixed wings
moving at an angle of attack through the air to generate
lift and a separate propulsive device to generate
thrust. He recognized that the function of thrust was
to overcome aerodynamic drag. In his own words, he
stated that the basic aspect of a flying machine is “to
make a surface support a given weight by the application
of power to the resistance of air.”
To key on Cayley’s seminal ideas, the nineteenth
century was full of abortive attempts to actually build
and fly fixed-wing, powered, human-carrying flying
machines. Cayley himself built several full-size aircraft
over the span of his long life (he died in 1857 at the age
of eighty-three), but was unsuccessful in achieving
sustained flight. Some of the most important wouldbe
inventors of the airplane were William Samuel
Henson and John Stringfellow in England, Felix Du
Temple in France, and Alexander Mozhaiski in
Russian. They were all unsuccessful in achieving sustained
flight. In regard to the nature of airplane performance
and design, we note that these enthusiastic
but unsuccessful inventors were obsessed with horsepower
(or thrust). They were mainly concerned with
equipping their aircraft with engines powerful enough
to accelerate the machine to a velocity high enough
that the aerodynamic lift of the wings would become
large enough to raise the machine off the ground and
into the air. Unfortunately, they all suffered from the
same circular argument—the more powerful the
engine, the more it weighs; the heavier the machine is,
the faster it must move to produce enough lift to get
off the ground; the faster the machine must move, the
more powerful (and hence heavier) the engine must
be—which is where we entered this circular argument.
A way out of this quandary is to develop engines
with more power without an increase in engine
weight, or more precisely, to design engines with large
horsepower-to-weight ratios. The thrust-to-weight
ratio, T/W, for the entire aircraft, is a critical parameter
in airplane performance and design. In the nineteenth
century, inventors of flying machines functioned
mainly on the basis of intuition, with little quantitative
analysis to guide them. They knew that, to accelerate
the aircraft, thrust had to be greater than the drag; that
is, T - D had to be a positive number. And the larger
the thrust and the smaller the drag, the better things
were. In essence, most of the nineteenth-century flying
machine inventors were obsessed with brute
force—given enough thrust (or horsepower) from the
engine, the airplane could be wrestled into the air. The
aviation historians call such people “chauffeurs.” They
were so busy trying to get the flying machine off the
ground that they paid little attention to how the
machine would be controlled once it got into the air;
their idea was that somehow the machine could be
chauffeured in the air much as a carriage driven on the
ground. This philosophy led to failure in all such cases.
The antithesis of the chauffeur’s philosophy was
the “airman’s” approach. In order to design a successful
flying machine, it was necessary to first get up
in the air and experience flight with a vehicle unencumbered
by a power plant; that is, you should learn
to fly before putting an engine on the aircraft. The
person who introduced and pioneered the airman’s
philosophy was Otto Lilienthal, a German mechanical
engineer, who designed and flew the first successful
gliders in history. Lilienthal first carried out a long
series of carefully organized aerodynamic experiments,
covering a period of about twenty years, from
which he clearly demonstrated the aerodynamic
superiority of cambered (curved) airfoils in comparison
to flat, straight surfaces. His experiments were
extensive and meticulously carried out. They were
published in 1890 in a book entitled “Der Vogelflug
als Grundlage der Fliegekunst” (“Bird Flight as the
Basis of Aviation”); this book was far and away the
most important and definitive contribution to the
budding science of aerodynamics to appear in the
nineteenth century. It greatly influenced aeronautical
design for the next fifteen years, and was the bible for
the early work of the Wright brothers. Lilienthal’s
aerodynamic research led to a quantum jump in aerodynamics
at the end of the nineteenth century.
The last, and perhaps the most dramatic, failure of
the pre-Wright era was the attempt by Samuel P.
Langley to build a flying machine for the U.S. government.
Intensely interested in the physics and
technology of powered flight, Langley began a series
of aerodynamic experiments in 1887, using a
whirling arm apparatus. At the time, he was the
director of the Allegheny Observatory in Pittsburgh.
Within a year he seized the opportunity to become
the third Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution in
Washington, D.C. Langley continued with his aeronautical
experiments, including the building and flying
of a number of elastic-powered models. The
results of his whirling arm experiments were published
in 1890 in his book Experiments in
Aerodynamic. In 1896, Langley was successful in flying
several small-scale, unmanned, powered aircraft,
which he called aerodromes. These 14-ft-wingspan,
steam-powered aerodromes were launched from the
top of a small houseboat on the Potomac River, and
they flew for about a minute, covering close to 1 mi
over the river. These were the first steam-powered,
heavier-than-air machines to successfully fly—a historic
event in the history of aeronautics that is not
always appreciated today.
This was to be the zenith of Langley’s success.
Spurred by the exigency of the Spanish-American
War, Langley was given a $50,000 grant from the War
Department to construct and fly a full-scale, personcarrying
aerodrome. He hired an assistant, Charles
Manly, who had just graduated from the Sibley
School of Mechanical Engineering at Cornell
University. Together, they set out to build the
required flying machine. The advent of the gasolinepowered
internal-combustion engine in Europe convinced
them that the aerodrome should be powered
by a gasoline-fueled reciprocating engine turning a
propeller.
By 1901 Manly had assembled a radically designed
five-cylinder radial engine. It weighed 200 lb, produced
a phenomenal 52.4 hp, and was the best airplane
power plant designed until the beginning of
World War I. The full-scale aerodrome, equipped
with his engine, was ready in 1903. Manly attempted
two flights; both resulted in the aerodrome’s falling
into the water moments after its launch by a catapult
mounted on top of a new houseboat on the Potomac
River.
Langley’s aerodrome and the fate that befell it are
an excellent study in the basic aspects of airplane
design. Despite excellent propulsion and adequate
aerodynamics, it was the poor structural design that
resulted in failure of the whole system.
ERA OF STRUT-AND-WIRE BIPLANES
The 1903 Wright Flyer ushered in the era of successful
strut-and-wire biplanes, an era that covers the
period from 1903 to 1930. There is no doubt in this
author’s mind that Orville and Wilbur Wright were
the first true aeronautical engineers in history. With
the 1903 Wright Flyer, they had gotten it all right—
the propulsion, aerodynamic, structural, and control
aspects were carefully calculated and accounted for
during its design. The Wright brothers were the first
to fully understand the airplane as a whole and complete
system, in which the individual components
had to work in a complementary fashion so that the
integrated system would perform as desired.
Let us dwell for a moment on the Wright Flyer as
an airplane design. The Wright Flyer possessed all the
elements of a successful flying machine. Propulsion
was achieved by a four-cylinder in-line engine
designed and built by Orville Wright with the help of
their newly hired mechanic in the bicycle shop,
Charlie Taylor. It produced close to 12 hp and
weighed 140 lb, barely on the margin of what the
Wrights had calculated as the minimum necessary to
get the flyer into the air. This engine drove two propellers
via a bicycle-like chain loop. The propellers
themselves were a masterpiece of aerodynamic
design. Wilbur Wright was the first person in history
to recognize the fundamental principle that a propeller
is nothing more than a twisted wing oriented
in a direction such that the aerodynamic force produced
by the propeller was predominately in the
thrust direction. Wilbur conceived the first viable
propeller theory in the history of aeronautical engineering;
vestiges of Wilbur’s analyses carry through
today in the standard “blade element” propeller theory.
The Wrights had built a wind tunnel, and during
the fall and winter of 1901 to 1902, they carried out
tests on hundreds of different airfoil and wing shapes.
Wilbur incorporated these experimental data in his
propeller analyses; the result was a propeller with an
efficiency that was close to 70 percent (propeller efficiency
is the power output from the propeller compared
to the power input to the propeller from the
engine shaft). This represented a dramatic improvement
of propeller performance over contemporary
practice. For example, Langley reported a propeller
efficiency of only 52 percent for his aerodromes.
Today, a modern, variable-pitch propeller can
achieve efficiencies as high as 85 to 90 percent. In
1903, the Wrights’ propeller efficiency of 70 percent
was simply phenomenal. It was one of the lesserknown
but most compelling reasons for the success
of the Wright Flyer. With their marginal engine
linked to their highly efficient propellers, the Wrights
had the propulsion aspect of airplane design well in
hand.
The aerodynamic features of the Wright Flyer
were predominately a result of their wind tunnel tests
of numerous wing and airfoil shapes. The Wrights
were well aware that the major measure of aerodynamic
efficiency is the lift-to-drag ratio L/D. They
knew that the lift of an aircraft must equal its weight
in order to sustain the machine in the air, and that
almost any configuration could produce enough lift if
the angle of attack was sufficiently large. But the
secret of “good aerodynamics” is to produce this lift
with as small a drag as possible, that is, to design an
aircraft with as large an L/D value as possible. To
accomplish this, the Wrights did three things:
1. They chose an airfoil shape that, based on the
collective data from their wind tunnel tests,
would give a high L/D. The airfoil used on the
Wright Flyer was a thin, cambered shape, with a
camber ratio (ratio of maximum camber to
chord length) of 1/20, with the maximum camber
near the quarter-chord location. (In contrast,
Lilienthal favored airfoils that were
circular arcs, i.e., with maximum camber at
midchord.) It is interesting that the precise airfoil
shape used for the Wright Flyer was never
tested by the Wright brothers in their wind tunnel.
By 1903, they had so much confidence in
their understanding of airfoil and wing properties
that, in spite of their characteristic conservative
philosophy, they felt it unnecessary to test
that specific shape.
2. They chose an aspect ratio of 6 for the wings.
(Aspect ratio is defined as the square of the wing
span divided by the wing area; for a rectangular
wing, the aspect ratio is simply the ratio of the
span to the chord length.) They had experimented
with gliders at Kitty Hawk in the summers
of 1900 and 1901, and they were quite
disappointed in their aerodynamic performance.
The wing aspect ratio of these early gliders
was 3. However, their wind tunnel tests
clearly indicated that higher-aspect-ratio wings
produced higher values of L/D. (This was not a
new discovery; the advantage of high-aspectratio
wings had been first theorized by Francis
Wenham in 1866. Langley’s whirling arm data,
published in 1890, proved conclusively that better
performance was obtained with higheraspect-
ratio wings. Based on their own wind
tunnel results, the Wrights immediately adopted
an aspect ratio of 6 for their 1902 glider, and
the following year for the 1903 flyer. At the
time, the Wrights had no way of knowing about
the existence of induced drag; this aerodynamic
phenomenon was not understood until the
work of Ludwig Prandtl in Germany fifteen
years later. The Wrights did not know that, by
increasing the aspect ratio from 3 to 6, they
reduced the induced drag by a factor of 2. They
only knew from their empirical results that the
L/D ratio of the 6-aspect-ratio wing was much
improved over their previous wing designs.
3. The Wrights were very conscious of the importance
of parasite drag, which in their day was
called head resistance. They used empirical formulas
obtained from Octave Chanute to estimate
the head resistance for their machines.
(Octave Chanute was a well-known civil and
railroad engineer who had become very interested
in aeronautics. In 1893 he published an
important survey of past aeronautical work
from around the world in a book entitled
“Progress in Flying Machines.” It has become a
classic; you can still buy reprinted copies today.
From 1900, Octave Chanute was a close friend
and confidant of the Wright brothers, giving
them much encouragement during their intensive
inventive work in 1900 to 1903.) The
Wrights choice of lying prone while flying their
machines, rather than sitting up, or even dangling
underneath as Lilienthal had done, was a
matter of decreasing head resistance. In early
1903, they even tested a series of wooden struts
in an airstream in order to find the cross-sectional
shape that gave minimum drag.
Unfortunately, they did not appreciate the inordinately
high drag produced by the supporting
wires between the two wings.
The Wrights never quoted a value of L/D for their
1903 Wright Flyer. Modern wind tunnel tests of
models of the Wright Flyer carried out in 1982 and
1983 as reported by Culick and Jex at Cal Tech indicate
a maximum L/D of 6. This value is totally consistent
with values of (L/D)max measured by Gustave
Eiffel in 1910 in his large wind tunnel in Paris for
models of a variety of aircraft of that time. It has been
estimated that the Fokker E-111, an early World War
I aircraft had an (L/D)max of 6.4. In 1903 the Wrights
had achieved a value of (L/D)max with their flyer that
was as high as that for aircraft designed 10 years later.
The control features of the Wright Flyer are also
one of the basic reasons for its success. The Wright
brothers were the first to recognize the importance of
flight control around all three axes of the aircraft.
Pitch control, obtained by a deflection of all or part of
the horizontal tail (or the forward canard such as the
Wright Flyer), and yaw control, obtained by deflection
of the vertical rudder, were features recognized
by investigators before the Wrights; for example,
Langley’s aerodrome had pitch and yaw controls.
However, no one except the Wrights appreciated the
value of roll control. Their novel idea of differentially
warping the wing tips to control the rolling motion
of the airplane, and to jointly control roll and yaw for
coordinated turns, was one of their most important
contributions to aeronautical engineering. Indeed,
when Wilbur Wright finally carried out the first public
demonstrations of their flying machines in
LeMans, France, in August 1908, the two technical
features of the Wright machines most appreciated
and immediately copied by European aviators were
their roll control and their efficient propeller design.
Finally, the structural features of the Wright Flyer
were patterned partly after the work of Octave
Chanute and partly after their own experience in
designing bicycles. Chanute, inspired by the gliding
flights of Lilienthal, carried out tests of gliders of his
own design beginning in 1896. The most important
technical feature of Chanute’s gliders was the sturdy
and lightweight Pratt-truss method of rigging a
biplane structure. The Wright brothers adopted the
Pratt-truss system for the Wright Flyer directly from
Chanute’s work. Other construction details of the
Wright Flyer took advantage of the Wrights’ experience
in designing and building sturdy but lightweight
bicycles. When it was finished, engine included, the
empty weight of the Wright Flyer was 605 lb. With a
150-lb person on board, the empty weight-gross
weight ratio was 0.8. By comparison, the empty
weight of the Fokker E-111 designed 10 years later
was 878 lb, and the empty weight-gross weight ratio
was 0.65, not greatly different from that of the Wright
Flyer. Considering that 10 years of progress in aircraft
structural design had been made between the
1903 flyer and the Fokker E-111, the structural
design of the 1903 Wright Flyer certainly seems technically
advanced for its time. And the fact that the
flyer was structurally sound was certainly well
demonstrated on December 17, 1903.
In summary, the Wright brothers had gotten it
right. All the components of their system worked
properly and harmoniously—propulsion, aerodynamics,
control, and structures. There were no fatal
weak links. The reason for this was the natural inventiveness
and engineering abilities of Orville and
Wilbur Wright. The design of the Wright Flyer is a
classic first study in good aeronautical engineering.
There can be no doubt that the Wright brothers were
the first true aeronautical engineers.
The Wright Flyer ushered in the era of strut-andwire
biplanes, and it basically set the pattern for subsequent
airplane design during this era. The famous
World War I fighter airplanes—such as the French
Nieuport 17 and the SPAD XIII, the German Fokker
D. VII, and the British Sopwith Camel—were in
many respects “souped-up” Wright flyers.
First, the wing warping method of roll control used
by the Wrights was quickly supplanted by ailerons in
most other aircraft. (The idea of flaplike surfaces at
the trailing edges of airplane wings can be traced to
two Englishmen: M. P. W. Boulton, who patented a
concept for lateral control by ailerons in 1868; and
Richard Harte, who also filed for a similar patent in
1870). Ailerons in the form of triangular “winglets”
that projected beyond the usual wingtips were used in
1908 by Glenn Curtiss on his June Bug airplane; flying
the June Bug, Curtiss won the Scientific
American Prize on July 4, 1908, for the first public
flight of 1,000 m or longer. By 1909, Curtiss had
designed an improved airplane, the Gold Bug, with
rectangular ailerons located midway between the
upper and lower wings. Finally, in 1909 the
Frenchman Henri Farman designed a biplane named
the Henri Farman III, which included a flaplike
aileron at the trailing edge of all four wingtips; this
was the true ancestor of the conventional modern-day
aileron. Farman’s design was soon adopted by most
designers, and wing warping quickly became passé.
Only the Wright brothers clung to their old concept;
a Wright airplane did not incorporate ailerons until
1915, six years after Farman’s development.
Second, the open framework of the fuselage, such
as seen in the Wright Flyer, was in later designs
enclosed by fabric. The first airplane to have this feature
was a Nieuport monoplane built in 1910. This
was an attempt at “streamlining” the airplane,
although at that time the concept of streamlining was
only an intuitive process rather than the result of real
technical knowledge and understanding about drag
reduction.
Third, the demands for improved airplane performance
during World War I gave a rebirth to the
idea of “brute force” in airplane design. In relation to
the thrust minus drag expression T – D, designers of
World War I fighter airplanes, in their quest for faster
speeds and higher rates of climb, increased the thrust
rather than decreasing the drag. The focus was on
more powerful engines. The SPAD XIII, one of the
best and most famous aircraft from World War I, had
a Hispano-Suiza engine that produced 220 hp—the
most powerful engine used on a fighter aircraft at that
time. Because of this raw power, the SPAD XIII had a
maximum velocity of 134 mph which made it one of
the fastest airplanes during the war. The SPAD XIII
typifies the strut-and-wire biplane: the struts and
wires produced large amounts of drag, although this
was not fully understood by most airplane designers at
that time. In fact, in the March 1924 issue of the
Journal of the Royal Aeronautical Society, the noted
British aeronautical engineer Sir Leonard Bairstow
was prompted to say, “Our war experience showed
that, whilst we went forward as regard to horsepower,
we went backwards with regard to aerodynamic efficiency.”
Aircraft design during World War I was an
intuitive “seat-of-the-pants” process. Some designs
were almost literally marked off in chalk on the concrete
floor of a factory, and the completed machines
rolled out the front door two weeks later.
ERA OF THE MATURE,
PROPELLER-DRIVEN AIRPLANE
The period from 1930 to 1950 can be classified as the
era of the mature, propeller-driven airplane. During
this time, airplane design matured, new technical features
were incorporated, and the speed, altitude, efficiency,
and safety of aircraft increased markedly. The
1930s are considered by many aviation historians as
the “golden age of aviation” (indeed, there is currently
a gallery at the National Air and Space Museum
with this title). Similarly, the 1930s might be considered
as a golden age for aeronautical engineering—a
period when many improved design features, some
gestating since the early 1920s, finally became accepted
and incorporated on “standard” aircraft of the age.
The maturity of the propeller-driven airplane is
due to nine major technical advances, all of which
came to fruition during the 1930s.
Cantilevered-Wing Monoplane
Hugo Junkers in Germany during World War I
and Anthony Fokker in Holland during the 1920s
pioneered the use single-wing aircraft (monoplanes).
This was made possible by the introduction of thick
airfoils, which among other advantages allowed room
for a large cantilevered spar that structurally supported
the wing internally. This eliminated the need for
the biplane box structure with its external supporting
struts and wires. Consequently, the drag of monoplanes
was less than that of comparable strut-andwire
biplanes.
The All-Metal Airplane
The vast majority of airplanes before 1930 were
constructed from wood and fabric, with some having
a steel tube frame mechanism for the fuselage, over
which fabric was stretched. Although Hugo Junkers
designed and built the first all-metal airplane in 1915,
this design feature was not adopted by others for
many years. The case for the all-metal airplane was
strengthened when the famous Notre Dame football
coach Knute Rockne was killed on March 31, 1931,
in the crash of a Fokker tri-motor transport. This
shook the public’s faith in the tri-motor design, and
essentially led to its demise in the United States.
Such concern was misdirected. Later investigation
showed that the wooden wing spar (the entire wing
of the Fokker tri-motor was made from wood) had
rotted, and the crash was due to this structural failure.
What better case could be made for all-metal construction?
Air-Cooled Engines and the NACA Cowling
Propeller-driven airplanes have two types of reciprocating
engines—liquid cooled, or air-cooled
engines. Since the early days of flight, liquid-cooled
engines had the advantage of being longer and thinner,
allowing them to be enclosed in relatively
streamlined housings with less frontal drag.
However, such engines were more vulnerable to
damage during combat—a bullet through any part of
the liquid cooling system would usually spell failure
of the engine. Also, liquid-cooled engines were heavy
due to all the machinery and cooling jackets that were
associated with the liquid cooling mechanism. In
contrast, air-cooled engines, where the cylinder
heads are directly exposed to, and cooled by, the
airstream over the airplane, are lighter. They require
fewer moving parts, and therefore tend to be more
reliable. The development of the powerful and reliable
Pratt and Whitney Wasp series and the Curtiss-
Wright Cycline series of air-cooled radial engines
during the late 1920s and the 1930s resulted in the
widespread adoption of these engines. But with the
cylinders exposed directly to the airstream, the drag
created by these was inordinately large.
This set the stage for a major technical development
during this era, namely the National Advisory
Committee for Aeronautics (NACA) cowling for
radial piston engines. Such engines have their pistons
arranged in a circular fashion about the crankshaft,
and the cylinders themselves are cooled by airflow
over the outer finned surfaces. Until 1927, these
cylinders were usually directly exposed to the main
airstream of the airplane, causing inordinately high
drag. Engineers recognized this problem, but early
efforts to enclose the engines inside an aerodynamically
streamlined shroud (a cowling) interfered with
the cooling airflow, and the engines overheated. One
of the earliest aeronautical engineers to deal with this
problem was Colonel Virginius E. Clark (for whom
the famous Clark-Y airfoil is named). Clark designed
a primitive cowling in 1922 for the Dayton-Wright
XPSI airplane; it was marginal at best, and Clark had
no proper aerodynamic explanation as to why a cowling
worked. The first notable progress was made by
H. L. Townend at the National Physical Laboratory
in England. In 1927, Townend designed a ring of relative
short length that wrapped around the outside of
the cylinders. This resulted in a noticeable decrease
in drag, and at least it did not interfere with engine
cooling. Engine designers who were concerned with
the adverse effect of a full cowling on engine cooling
were more ready to accept a ring.
The greatest breakthrough in engine cowlings was
due to the National Advisory Committee for
Aeronautics in the United States. Beginning in 1927,
at the insistence of a group of U.S. aircraft manufacturers,
the NACA Langley Memorial Laboratory at
Hampton, Virginia, undertook a systematic series of
wind tunnel tests with the objective of understanding
the aerodynamics of engine cowlings and designing
an effective shape for such cowlings. Under the direction
of Fred E. Weick at Langley Laboratory, this work
quickly resulted in success. Drag reduction larger
than that with a Townend ring was obtained by the
NACA cowling. In 1928, Weick published a report
comparing the drag on a fuselage-engine combination
with and without a cowling. Compared with the
uncowled fuselage, a full cowling reduced the drag by
a stunning 60 percent. By proper aerodynamic design
of the cowling, the airflow between the engine and
the inside of the cowling resulted in enhanced cooling
of the engine. Hence, the NACA cowling was achieving
the best of both worlds. One of the first airplanes
to use the NACA cowling was the Lockheed Vega,
shown in Figure 1. Early versions of the Vega without
a cowling had a top speed of 135 mph; after the
NACA cowling was added to later versions, the top
speed increased to 155 mph. The Lockheed Vega
went on to become one of the most successful airplanes
of the 1930s. The Vega 5, equipped with the
NACA cowling and a more powerful engine, had a
top speed of 185 mph. It was used extensively in passenger
and corporate service. In addition, Amelia
Earhart and Wiley Post became two of the most
famous aviators of the 1930s—both flying Lockheed
Vegas. Not only is the Vega a classic example of the
new era of mature propeller-driven airplanes, but its
aesthetic beauty supported the popular adage “If an
airplane looks beautiful, it will also fly beautifully.”
Variable-Pitch and Constant-Speed
Propellers
Before the 1930s, a weak link in all propeller-driven
aircraft was the propeller itself. For a propeller of
fixed orientation, the twist of the propeller is designed
so that each airfoil section is at its optimum angle of
attack to the relative airflow, usually that angle of
attack that corresponds to the maximum lift-to-drag
ratio of the airfoil. The relative airflow seen by each
airfoil section is the vector sum of the forward motion
of the airplane and the rotational motion of the propeller.
When the forward velocity of the airplane is
changed, the angle of attack of each airfoil section
changes relative to the local flow direction. Thus a
fixed-pitch propeller is operating at maximum effi-
ciency only at its design speed; for all other speeds of
the airplane, the propeller efficiency decreases.
The solution to this problem was to vary the pitch
of the propeller during the flight so as to operate at
near-optimum conditions over the flight range of the
airplane—a mechanical task easier said than done.
The aerodynamic advantage of varying the propeller
pitch during flight was appreciated as long ago as
World War I, and H. Hele-Shaw and T. E. Beacham
patented such a device in England in 1924. The first
practical and reliable mechanical device for varying
propeller pitch was designed by Frank Caldwell of
Hamilton Standard in the United States. The first
production order for Caldwell’s design was placed by
Boeing in 1933 for use on the Boeing 247 transport.
The 247 was originally designed in 1932 with fixedpitch
propellers. When it started flying in early 1933,
Boeing found that the airplane had inadequate takeoff
performance from some of the airports high in the
Rocky Mountains. By equipping the 247 with variable-
pitch propellers, this problem was solved. The
new propellers increased its rate of climb by 22 percent
and its cruising velocity by over 5 percent. Later
in the 1930s, the variable-pitch propeller, which was
controlled by the pilot, developed into the constantspeed
propeller, where the pitch was automatically
controlled so as to maintain constant rpm over the
flight range of the airplane. Because the power output
of the reciprocating engine varies with rotational
speed, by having a propeller in which the pitch is continuously
and automatically varied to constant engine
speed, the net power output of the engine-propeller
combination can be maintained at an optimum value.
High-Octane Aviation Fuel
Another important advance in the area of propulsion
was the development of high-octane aviation fuel,
although it was eclipsed by the more visibly obvious
breakthroughs in the 1930s such as the NACA cowling,
retractable landing gear, and the variable-pitch
propeller. Engine “pinging,” an audible local detonation
in the engine cylinder caused by premature ignition,
had been observed as long ago as 1911. An
additive to the gasoline, tetraethyl lead, was found by
C. F. Kettering of General Motors Delco to reduce
this engine knocking. In turn, General Motors and
Standard Oil formed a new company, Ethyl Gasoline
Corporation, to produce “ethyl” gasoline with a lead
additive. Later, the hydrocarbon compound of octane
was also found to be effective in preventing engine
knocking. In 1930, the Army Air Corps adopted 87-
octane gasoline as its standard fuel; in 1935, this standard
was increased to 100 octane. The introduction of
100-octane fuel allowed much higher compression
ratios inside the cylinder, and hence more power for
the engine. For example, the introduction of 100-
octane fuel, as well as other technological improvements,
allowed Curtiss-Wright Aeronautical
Corporation to increase the power of its R-1820
Cycline engine from 500 to 1,200 hp in the 1930s.
High-Lift Devices
When a new airplane is designed, the choice of wing
area is usually dictated by speed at takeoff or landing
(or alternatively by the desired takeoff or landing distances
along a runway). The wing area must be large
enough to provide sufficient lift at takeoff or landing;
this criterion dictates the ratio of airplane weight to
wing area, that is, the wing loading W/S—one of the
most important parameters in airplane performance
and design. After the airplane has taken off and accelerated
to a much higher cruising speed, the higher-
velocity airflow over the wing creates a larger pressure
difference between the upper and lower wing surfaces,
and therefore the lift required to sustain the weight of
the airplane can be created with a smaller wing area.
From this point of view, the extra wing required for
takeoff and landing is extra baggage at cruising conditions,
resulting in higher structural weight and
increased skin friction drag. The design of airplanes in
the era of strut-and-wire biplanes constantly suffered
from this compromise. A partial solution surfaced in
the late 1920s and 1930s, namely, the development of
high-lift devices such as flaps, slats, and slots. Figure 2
illustrates some of the standard high-lift devices
employed on aircraft since the 1920s, along with a scale
of lift coefficient indicating the relative increase in lift
provided by each device. By employing such high-lift
devices, sufficient lift can be obtained at takeoff and
landing with wings of smaller area, allowing airplane
designers the advantage of high wing loadings at
cruise. High-lift devices were one of the important
technical developments during the era of the mature
propeller-driven airplane.
Pressurized Aircraft
Another technical development of the late 1930s
is the advent of the pressurized airplane. Along with
the decrease in atmospheric pressure with increasing
altitude, there is the concurrent decrease in the volume
of oxygen necessary for human breathing. The
useful cruising altitude for airplanes was limited to
about 18,000 ft or lower. Above this altitude for any
reasonable length of time, a human being would
soon lose consciousness due to lack of oxygen. The
initial solution to the problem of sustained highaltitude
flight was the pressure suit and the auxiliary
oxygen supply breathed through an oxygen mask.
The first pilot to use a pressure suit was Wiley Post.
Looking like a deep-sea diver, Post set an altitude
record of 55,000 ft in his Lockheed Vega in
December 1934. This was not a practical solution for
the average passenger on board an airliner. The
answer was to pressurize the entire passenger cabin
of the airplane, so as to provide a shirtsleeve environment
for the flight crew and passengers. The first
airplane to incorporate this feature was a specially
modified and structurally strengthened Lockheed
IOE Electra for the Army Air Corps in 1937.
Designated the XC-35, this airplane had a service
ceiling of 32,000 ft. It was the forerunner of all the
modern pressurized airliners of today.
Superchargers for Engines
Along with pressurization for the occupants, highaltitude
aircraft needed “pressurization” for the
engine. Engine power is nearly proportional to the
atmospheric density; without assistance, engine
power dropped too low at high altitudes, and this was
the major mechanical obstacle to high-altitude flight.
Assistance came in the form of the supercharger, a
mechanical pump that compressed the incoming
air before it went into the engine manifold.
Supercharger development was a high priority during
the 1930s and 1940s; it was a major development program
within NACA. All high-performance military
aircraft during World War II were equipped with
superchargers as a matter of necessity.
Streamlining
One of the most important developments in the
era of the mature propeller-driven airplane was the
appreciation of the need for streamlining the airframe.
The rather box-like shape of the World War I
vintage SPAD was characteristic of airplanes of that
day. There was little if any attempt to shape the airplane
into a streamlined configuration. The Douglas
DC-3, however, was designed and began airline service
in the mid-1930s. Here is streamlining personified.
By comparison, the zero-lift-drag coefficient for
the SPAD is 0.04, whereas that for the DC-3 is about
0.025, a considerable improvement. Part of the concept
of streamlining was to retract the landing gear
flush with the external airframe.
Summary
The Douglas DC-3 epitomizes the mature, propeller-
driven aircraft of the 1930s. Here you see a
cantilever wing monoplane powered by radial
engines enclosed in NACA cowlings, and equipped
with variable-pitch propellers. It is an all-metal airplane
with retractable landing gear, and it uses flaps
for high lift during takeoff and landing. For these reasons,
the 1930s can indeed be called the golden age of
aeronautical engineering.
ERA OF THE JET-PROPELLED AIRPLANE
The jet engine was invented independently by two
people: Frank Whittle in England and Dr. Hans von
Ohain in Germany. In 1928, as a student at the Royal
Air Force technical college at Cranwell, Frank
Whittle wrote a senior thesis entitled “Future
Developments in Aircraft Design” in which he
expounded on the virtues of jet propulsion. It
aroused little interest. Although Whittle patented his
design for a gas-turbine aircraft engine in 1930, it was
not until five years later that he formed, with the help
of friends, a small company to work on jet engine
development. Named Power Jets Ltd., this company
was able to successfully bench-test a jet engine on
April 12, 1937—the first jet engine in the world to
successfully operate in a practical fashion. It was not
the first to fly. Quite independently, and completely
without the knowledge of Whittle’s work, Dr. Hans
von Ohain in Germany developed a similar gas-turbine
engine. Working under the private support of
the famous airplane designer Ernst Heinkel, von
Ohain started his work in 1936. On August 27, 1939,
a specially designed Heinkel airplane, the He 178,
powered by von Ohain’s jet engine, successfully flew;
it was the first gas turbine-powered, jet-propelled air-

North American F-86H
plane in history to fly. It was strictly an experimental
airplane, but von Ohain’s engine of 838 lb of thrust
pushed the He 178 to a maximum speed of 360 mph.
It was not until almost two years later that a British
jet flew. On May 15, 1941, the specially designed
Gloster E.28/39 airplane took off from Cranwell,
powered by a Whittle jet engine. It was the first to fly
with a Whittle engine. With these first flights in
Germany and Britain, the jet age had begun.
The era of jet-propelled aircraft is characterized by
a number of design features unique to airplanes
intended to fly near, at, or beyond the speed of
sound. One of the most pivotal of these design features
was the advent of the swept wing. For a subsonic
airplane, sweeping the wing increases the
airplane’s critical Mach number, allowing it to fly
closer to the speed of sound before encountering the
large drag rise caused by the generation of shock
waves somewhere on the surface of the wing. For a
supersonic airplane, the wing sweep is designed such
that the wing leading edge is inside the Mach cone
from the nose of the fuselage; if this is the case, the
component of airflow velocity perpendicular to the
leading edge is subsonic (called a subsonic leading
edge), and the resulting wave drag is not as severe as
it would be if the wing were to lie outside the Mach
cone. In the latter case, called the supersonic leading
edge, the component of flow velocity perpendicular
to the leading edge is supersonic, with an attendant
shock wave generated at the leading edge. In either
case, high subsonic or supersonic, an airplane with a
swept wing will be able to fly faster than one with a
straight wing, everything else being equal.
The concept of the swept wing for high-speed aircraft
was first introduced in a public forum in 1935.
At the fifth Volta Conference, convened on
September 30, 1935, in Rome, Italy, the German
aerodynamicist Adolf Busernann gave a paper in
which he discussed the technical reasons why swept
wings would have less drag at high speeds than conventional
straight wings. Although several Americans
were present, such as Eastmann Jacobs from
NACA and Theodore von Karman from Cal Tech,
Busernann’s idea went virtually unnoticed; it was not
carried back to the United States with any sense of
importance. Not so in Germany. One year after
Busemann’s presentation at the Volta Conference,
the swept-wing concept was classified by the German
Luftwaffe as a military secret. The Germans went on
to produce a large bulk of swept-wing research,
including extensive wind tunnel testing. They even
designed a few prototype swept-wing jet aircraft.
Many of these data were confiscated by the United
States after World War II, and made available to U.S.
aircraft companies and government laboratories.
Meanwhile, quite independently of this German
research, Robert T. Jones, a NACA aerodynamicist,
had worked out the elements of swept-wing theory
toward the end of the war. Although not reinforced
by definitive wind tunnel tests in the United States at
that time, Jones’s work served as a second source of
information concerning the viability of swept wings.
In 1945, aeronautical engineers at North American
Aircraft began the design of the XP-86 jet fighter; it
had a straight wing. The XP-86 design was quickly
changed to a swept-wing configuration when the
German data, as well as some of the German engineers,
became available after the war. The prototype
XP-86 flew on October 1, 1947, and the first production
P-86A flew with a 35° swept wing on May 18,
1948. Later designated the F-86, the swept-wing
fighter had a top speed of 679 mph, essentially Mach
0.9—a stunning speed for that day. Shown in Figure
3, the North American F-86 Sabre was the world’s
first successful operational swept-wing aircraft.
By the time the F-86 was in operation, the sound

barrier had already been broken. On October 14,
1947, Charles (Chuck) Yeager became the first
human being to fly faster than the speed of sound in
the Bell X-1 rocket-powered airplane. In February
1954, the first fighter airplane capable of sustained
flight at Mach 2, the Lockheed F-104 Starfighter,
made its first appearance. The F-104, Figure 4, exhibited
the best qualities of good supersonic aerodynamics—
a sharp, pointed nose, slender fuselage, and
extremely thin and sharp wings. The airfoil section
on the F-104 is less than 4 percent thick (maximum
thickness compared to the chord length). The wing
leading edge is so sharp that protective measures
must be taken by maintenance people working
around the aircraft. The purpose of these features is
to reduce the strength of shock waves at the nose and
trailing edges, thus reducing supersonic wave drag.
The F-104 also had a straight wing with a very low
aspect ratio rather than a swept wing. This exhibits an
alternative to supersonic airplane designers; the wave
drag on straight wings of low aspect ratio is comparable
to that on swept wings with high aspect ratios. Of
course, this low-aspect-ratio wing gives poor aerodynamic
performance at subsonic speeds, but the F-104
was point-designed for maximum performance at
Mach 2. With the F-104, supersonic flight became an
almost everyday affair, not just the domain of
research aircraft.
The delta wing concept was another innovation to
come out of Germany during the 1930s and 1940s. In
1930, Alexander Lippisch designed a glider with a
delta configuration; the leading edges were swept
back by 20°. The idea had nothing to do with highspeed
flight at that time; the delta configuration had
some stability and control advantages associated with
its favorable center-of-gravity location. When
Busemann introduced his swept-wing ideas in 1935,
Lippisch and his colleagues knew they had a potential
high-speed wing in their delta configuration.
Lippisch continued his research on delta wings during
the war, using small models in German supersonic
wind tunnels. By the end of the war, he was
starting to design a delta wing ramjet-powered fighter.
Along with the German swept-wing data, this
delta wing technology was transferred to the United
States after the war; it served as the basis for an
extended wind tunnel test program on delta wings at
NACA Langley Memorial Laboratory.
The first practical delta wing aircraft was the
Convair F-102. The design of this aircraft is an inter-
esting story in its own right—a story of the interplay
between design and research, and between industry
and NACA. The F-102 was designed as a supersonic
airplane. Much to the embarrassment and frustration
of the Convair engineers, the prototype F-102 being
tested at Edwards Air Force Base during October
1953 and then again in January 1954 exhibited poor
performance and was unable to go supersonic. At the
same time, Richard Whitcomb at NACA Langley was
conducting wind tunnel tests on his “area rule” concept,
which called for the cross-sectional area of the
fuselage to be reduced in the vicinity of the wing. By
so doing, the transonic drag was substantially
reduced. The Convair engineers quickly adopted this
concept on a new prototype of the F-102, and it went
supersonic on its second flight. Convair went on to
produce 975 F-102s; the practical delta wing airplane
was a finally a reality.
The area rule was one of the most important technical
developments during the era of jet-propelled
airplanes. Today, almost all transonic and supersonic
aircraft incorporate some degree of area rule. For his
work on the area rule, Whitcomb received the Collier
Trophy, the highest award given in the field of aeronautics.
One of the most tragic stories in the annals of airplane
design occurred in the early 1950s. Keying on
England’s early lead in jet propulsion, de Havilland
Aircraft Company designed and flew the first commercial
jet transport, the de Havilland Comet.
Powered by four de Havilland Ghost jet engines, the
Comet carried 36 passengers for 2,000 mi at a speed
of 460 mph, cruising at relatively high altitudes near
or above 30,000 ft. The passenger cabin was pressurized;
indeed, the Comet was the first pressurized airplane
to fly for extended periods at such high
altitudes. Inasmuch as good airplane design is an evolutionary
process based on preceding aircraft, the de
Havilland designers had little precedent on which to
base the structural design of the pressurized fuselage.
The Comet entered commercial service with BOAC
(a forerunner of British Airways) in 1952. In 1954,
three Comets disintegrated in flight, and the airplane
was quickly withdrawn from service. The problem
was later found to be structural failure of the fuselage
while pressurized. De Havilland used countersunk
rivets in the construction of the Comet; reaming the
holes for the rivets produced sharp edges. After a
number of pressurization cycles, cracks in the fuselage
began to propagate from these sharp edges, leading
eventually to catastrophic failure. At the time, de
Havilland had a massive lead over all other aircraft
companies in the design of commercial jet aircraft.
While it was in service, the Comet was very popular
with the flying public, and it was a moneymaker for
BOAC. Had these failures not occurred, de
Havilland and England might have become the
world’s supplier of commercial jet aircraft rather than
Boeing and the United States.
In 1952, the same year as the ill-fated de Havilland
Comet went into service, the directors of Boeing
Company made a bold and risky decision to privately
finance and build a commercial jet prototype.
Designated the model 367-80, or simply called the
Dash 80 by the Boeing people, the prototype first
flew on July 15, 1954. It was a bold design that carried
over to the commercial field Boeing’s experience
in building swept-wing jet bombers for the Air Force
(the B-47 and later the B-52). Later renamed the
Boeing 707, the first production series of aircraft
were bought by Pan American Airlines and went into
service in 1958. The Boeing 707 (Figure 5), with its
swept wings and podded engines mounted on pylons
below the wings, set the standard design pattern for
all future large commercial jets. The design of the
707 was evolutionary because it stemmed from the
earlier experience at Boeing with jet bombers. But it
was almost revolutionary in the commercial field,
because no other airliner had ever (not even the
Comet) looked like that. Boeing’s risky gamble paid
off, and it transformed a predominately military aircraft
company into the world’s leader in the design
and manufacture of commercial jet transports.
Boeing made another bold move on April 15,
1966, when the decision was made to “go for the big
one.” Boeing had lost the Air Force’s C-5 competition
to Lockheed; the C-5 at the time was the largest
transport airplane in the world. Taking their losing
design a few steps further, Boeing engineers conceived
of the 747, the first wide-body commercial jet
transport. Bill Allen, president of Boeing at that time,
and Juan Trippe, president of Pan American Airlines,
shared the belief that the large, wide-body airplane
offered economic advantages for the future airline
passenger market, and they both jointly made the
decision to pursue the project. It was an even bolder
decision than that concerning the 707.
The gamble paid off. The Boeing 747 first flew in
February 1969, and it entered service for the first
time in January 1970 on Pan American’s New York—
London route. Boeing is still producing 747s.
What about commercial transportation at supersonic
speeds? In the 1960s this question was
addressed in Russia, the United States, England, and
France. The Tupolev Design Bureau in Russia
rushed a supersonic transport design into production
and service. The Tu-144 supersonic transport first
flew on December 31, 1968. More than a dozen of
these aircraft were built, but none entered extended
service, presumably due to unspecified problems.
One Tu-144 was destroyed in a dramatic accident at
the 1973 Paris Air Show. In the United States, the
government orchestrated a design competition for a
supersonic transport; the Boeing 2707 was the winner
in December 1966. The design turned into a
nightmare for Boeing. For two years, a variablesweep
wing supersonic transport (SST) configuration
was pursued, and then the design was junked.
Starting all over again in 1969, the design was caught
up in an upward spiral of increased weight and development
costs. When the predictions for final development
costs hit about $5 billion, Congress stepped
in and refused to appropriate any more funds. In May
1971, the SST development program in the United
States was terminated. Only in England and France
was the SST concept carried to fruition.
The first, and so far only, supersonic commercial
transport to see long-term regular service was the
Anglo-French Concorde (Figure 6). In 1960 both
the British and French independently initiated
design studies for a supersonic transport. It quickly
became apparent that the technical complexities and
financial costs were beyond the abilities of either
country to shoulder alone. On November 29, 1962,
England and France signed a formal agreement
aimed at the design and construction of a supersonic
transport. The product of this agreement was the
Aerospatiale-British Aerospace Corporation’s
Concorde. Designed to cruise at Mach 2.2 and carry
125 passengers, the Concorde first flew on March 2,
1969. It first exceeded Mach 1 on October 1, 1969,
and Mach 2 on November 4, 1970. Originally,
orders for 74 Concordes were anticipated. When the
airlines were expected to place orders in 1973, the
world was deep in the energy crisis. The skyrocketing
costs of aviation jet fuel wiped out any hope of an
economic return from flying the Concorde, and no
orders were placed. Only the national airlines of
France and Britain, Air France and British Airways,
went ahead, each signing up for seven aircraft after
considerable pressure from their respective governments.
After a long development program, the
Concorde went into service on January 21, 1976. In
the final analysis, the Concorde was a technical, if
not financial, success. It was in regular service from
1976 until the entire fleet was grounded in the wake
of the first concorde crash in August 2000. It represents
an almost revolutionary airplane design in that
no such aircraft existed before it. The Concorde
designers were not operating in a vacuum.
Examining Figure 6, we see a supersonic configuration
which incorporates good supersonic aerodynamics—
a sharp-nosed slender fuselage and a
cranked delta wing with a thin airfoil. The Concorde
designers had at least fifteen years of military airplane
design experience with such features to draw
upon. Today, we know that any future second-generation
SST will have to be economical in service
and environmentally acceptable. The design of such
a vehicle is one of the great challenges in aeronautics.
In summary, the types of aircraft in use today cut
across the flight spectrum from low-speed, propellerdriven
airplanes with reciprocating engines, moderate
speed turboprop airplanes (propeller driven by gas
turbine engines), and high-speed jet-propelled airplanes.
For low-speed flight, below about 250 mph,
the reciprocating engine/propeller combination has
by far the best propulsive efficiency. For moderate
speeds (250–400 mph) the turboprop is superior.
This is why most high-performance commuter aircraft
are powered by turboprops. For high speeds (at
least above 500 mph) the jet engine is the only logical
powerplant choice; a propeller rapidly looses efficiency
at higher flight speeds. In short, a reciprocating
engine/propeller combination is a high efficiency, but
comparably low thrust powerplant, and a jet engine is
a lower efficiency but higher thrust powerplant. The
turboprop is a middle-ground compromise between
thrust and efficiency. The wide variety of airplanes in
use today draw on the technology developed in both
the era of the mature, propeller-driven airplane and
the era of the jet-propelled airplane. In the future,
airplane design will continue to be influenced by the
desire to fly faster and higher, but moderated by the
need for environmental effectiveness, economic viability,
and energy efficiency.
