<h1><strong>ACID RAIN</strong></h1>

<div>
<p>
“Acid rain” is a popular term that can include all
forms of precipitation (as well as fog and cloudwater)
that is more acidic than expected from natural causes.
Measurement of precipitation acidity at several
remote sites around the world show natural background
levels of acidity to be around pH of 5.1 to 5.2
(8 to 6 ueq/l H+ or hydrogen in concentration,
respectively). This compares with present annual
average values of pH 4.3 to 4.4 (50 to 40 ueq/l H+) for
most of the northeastern and midwestern United
States. Note that as pH decreases, H+ concentration
or acidity increases exponentially. Individual storms,
especially in the summer, can often produce pH values
below 3.5 (>300 ueq/l H+). Cloudwater and fog
often show even higher concentrations of acidity and
this has major implications for high-elevation ecosystems
such as mountain forests and water bodies. A
more appropriate term than acid rain is “acid deposition,”
which includes both wet and dry deposition of
acidic sulfur and nitrogen compounds to the earth’s
surface from the atmosphere.
</p>

<p>
Acid deposition is of greatest concern wherever
there are large amounts of fossil fuel combustion
upwind of an area. Eastern North America, large
areas of Europe, and eastern Asia all receive acidic
deposition. Acidic deposition is especially a concern
when poorly buffered soils, with little acid-neutralizing
capacity, are impacted. In North America, large
areas of eastern Canada, the Adirondack Mountains
of upstate New York, and sections of New England
all are considered “acid sensitive “ areas, where resistant
bedrocks and thin soils prevent significant neutralization
of acidity.
</p>
</div>

<p><strong>HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE</strong></p>

<div>
<p>
Acidic deposition is not a new phenomena, as E. B.
Cowling (1982) has noted. In 1872, the term “acid
rain” was first known to be used by Angus Smith to
describe the precipitation around Manchester,
England. Smith analyzed the chemistry of the rain
and attributed this acid rain to combustion of coal.
He also noted damage from acid rain to plants and
materials. C. Crowther and H. G. Ruston (1911)
demonstrated gradients in rainfall acidity decreasing
from the center of Leeds, England and associated the
acidity with coal combustion. E. Gorham (1957,
1958) established that acid precipitation affects the
acid-neutralizing capacity of lakes and bogs. A.
Dannevig (1959) of Norway recognized the relationship
between acid precipitation, lake and stream acidity,
and the disappearance of fish. S. Oden (1968)
used trajectory analysis to demonstrate that acid precipitation
in Sweden was the result of long-range
transport and transformation of sulfur emissions
from England and central Europe. In 1972, Likens et
al. identified acid precipitation in eastern North
America. G. E. Likens and F. H. Bormann (1974)
demonstrated its regional distribution in the eastern
United States and indicated that the transformation
of nitrogen oxides (NOx), as well as sulfur dioxide
(SO2), adds to precipitation acidity. D. W. Schindler
and his colleagues (1985) performed a whole lake
acidification in Canada and documented the adverse
decline of the lake food web at pH levels as high as
5.8. The issue of acid rain or deposition has generated
a vast amount of knowledge and understanding of
atmospheric and watershed processes, and research in
the field continues today.
</p>
</div>

<p><strong>FORMATION AND TRENDS</strong></p>

<div>
<p>
The formation of acidic deposition is largely from the
combustion of fossil fuels and the smelting of sulfide
ores. Minor natural sources exist such as the formation
of hydrochloric and sulfuric acid from gaseous
volcanic eruptions.
</p>

<p>
There are well over 100 gaseous and aqueous
phase reactions that can lead to acid formation and
more than fifty oxidizing agents and catalysts may be
involved. However, in the simplest terms sulfur in
fuels is oxidized to SO2, and SO2 in the atmosphere is
further oxidized and hydrolyzed to sulfuric acid.
Most nitric acid is formed by the fixation of atmospheric
nitrogen gas (N2) to NOx (NO and NO2) during
high temperature combustion, followed by
further oxidation and hydrolysis that produces nitric
acid in the atmosphere. These materials can be drydeposited
onto surfaces, or be removed from the
atmosphere by precipitation. The acid-generating
reactions can take from hours to days depending on a
wide range of atmospheric parameters such as temperature,
humidity, and the presence of oxidizing
agents such as hydroxl (OH) radicals, ozone (O3) and
hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). Depending on these conditions,
and other factors such as height of release and
wind speed, sulfur and nitrogen oxides can be transformed
and deposited as acid deposition anywhere
from a few kilometers to thousands of kilometers
from their original source. Figure 1 shows the geographic
distribution of acid deposition from precipitation
for the United States.
</p>

<p>
The U.S. trends in emissions SO2 and NOx from
1900 to 1997 are shown in Figure 2. The pattern for
SO2 emissions since 1900 has shown three peaks.
From 1900 to the 1920s there was a general increase
followed by a sharp decline during the Great
Depression of the 1930s. World War II produced
another peak, followed by a significant decline at the
end of World War II. SO2 emissions steadily rose
from the early 1950s to the early 1970s. The Clean Air
Act of 1970, which was directed at other air pollution
concerns and not directly at acid depositon, was largely
responsible for the decline in SO2 emissions. At the
time there was essentially no awareness that an “acid
rain” problem existed in North America. By 1995, the
implementation of the Clean Air Act Amendments
(CAAA) of which specifically targeted SO2 reductins
to reduce acid deposition began to further decrease
SO2 emissions in a large part of the eastern United
States, where acid deposition is most acute. NOx emissions
rose steadily until the 1970s when emissions leveled
off and then showed a very slight decline.
</p>
</div>

<p><strong>SOURCES OF ACID DEPOSITION</strong></p>

<div>
<p>
United States are presented in Figures 3 and 4
Major sources for emissions of SO2 and NOx in the
respectively. Approximately two-thirds of the SO2
emissions are from electric utilities. Efforts to reduce
SO2 emissions both nationally and regionally have
focused on electric utilities. The CAAA of 1990 have
stipulated a reduction of 9.1 million metric tons (10
million short tons) of SO2 below 1980 levels, with
most of this reduction coming from coal-fired power
plants. Implementation of Phase I reductions
(1995–2000) has been successful and has resulted in
an 18 percent decline in SO2 emissions from electric
utilities, compared with 1990 SO2 emissions. There
has been a 16 percent decline in SO2 for this time
period when all sources are considered. Phase 2 of
the CAAA, which is designed to reduce SO2 emissions
from electric utilities by another 20 percent
(compared to 1990), will go into effect from 2000 to
2005.
</p>

<p>
In the United States, recent reductions in emissions
of SO2 have been achieved by a shift to burning
low sulfur coal and by the introduction of SO2 scrubbers
that remove SO2 gases from power plant stacks.
Most of the reductions in SO2, mandated by the
CAAA have come from the shift to burning low sulfur
coal from the western United States. Electric utilities
account for about one-fourth of the NOx
emissions. However, the largest single sources of
NOx emissions are “on-road vehicles,” mainly cars
and trucks, which account for 30 percent of the NOx
emissions (Figure 4). Control of NOx emissions
from vehicles is technically more difficult to achieve.
Utilities can meet these targets for coal-fired boilers
by using low NOx burner technology (LNBT) or by
“emissions averaging.” Emissions averaging for a utility
requires over-control by one boiler to make up for
higher emissions at another boiler.

<p><strong>EFFECTS OF ACID DEPOSITION</strong></p>

<div>
<p>
Acid deposition and the associated particulate nitrates
and sulfates are implicated in the deterioration of certain
sensitive ecosystems, decreased visibility, negative
human health effects, and increased degradation
of certain stone building materials and cultural
resources, especially those made of limestone and
marble. Fine particulate nitrate and sulfate particles
associated with acid deposition are implicated in
aggravating cardiorespiratory diseases such as asthma
and chronic bronchitis, especially in urban areas.
In many cases estimating the impact of acid deposition
on various ecosystems can be a difficult process
because acid deposition is only one of many impacts
that can effect a response. However, wet and dry acid
deposition has been documented as a major factor in
the following ecosystem responses.
</p>
</div>

<p><strong>Aquatic Effects</strong></p>

<div>
<p>
In both Europe and eastern North America the
negative impacts of acid deposition were first documented
in lakes and streams found in acid-sensitive
areas. In the early 1970s the loss of fish populations
and increasing acidity in rural lakes and streams were
documented both in Scandinavia and North
America. In the United States, studies showed
increasing acidification of lakes and loss of fish populations
in the Adirondack Mountains of New York.
The increased dissolved inorganic aluminum leaching
from watersheds due to increased acidity proved
toxic to fish in this region. In addition to dissolved
aluminum toxicity, increased acidification leads to a
large-scale disruption of lake food webs. For example,
the experimental acidification of an entire
Canadian lake (pH 6.8 to pH 5.09 from 1976 to 1983)
led progressively to a loss of freshwater shrimp, all
minnow species, and crayfish. These were important
food sources for the lake trout population. By the end
of the experiment all fish reproduction had ceased.
There were also large changes in the species compositon
of smaller organisms (insects and crustaceans)
lower in the food chain.
</p>

<p>
Another aquatic impact of acid deposition is
episodic acidification. For example, one form of
episodic acidification occurs during spring snow
melt. When a winter snowpack first melts, acids and
other soluble material are concentrated and
released, causing an initial “acid pulse” of meltwater,
with acidity levels that may be higher than any
of the original snowfall. These highly acid episodes,
which are also often associated with high dissolved
aluminum concentration in runoff, can be especially
damaging in streams where fish and other organisms
cannot seek refuge in less acid waters. Large
storms, which produce high amounts of runoff during
other seasons, can also produce episodic acidification.
Historical evidence has linked acidic deposition to
the acidification of surface waters in many regions of
eastern North America and Europe. Thousands of
lakes and streams in these areas are significantly more
acid than they were a few decades ago. Large regions
of eastern Canada lying on the resistant bedrock of
the Precambrian Shield are sensitive to ongoing acidification.
In the eastern United States, surface water
acidification has occurred in the Adirondack
Mountains, the Pocono/Catskill region, the mid-
Appalachians, the eastern portion of the Upper
Midwest, the New Jersey Pine Barrens, and to a lesser
extent, the Florida panhandle. Even with reduced
emissions, acidification continues today in many
regions. One reason improvements have been smaller
than expected is that declines in sulfur emissions
have also been accompanied by declines in emissions
and deposition of acid-neutralizing agents found in
atmospheric dust, both in North America and
Europe. The most likely causes for the declines in
atmospheric dust are cleaner combustion processes,
controls on particulate emissions from smokestacks,
changing agricultural practices (no-till), and fewer
unpaved roads.
</p>

<p>
Controlling the effects of acid deposition by the
use of lime or other acid-neutralizing compounds has
been tried, but mainly on an experimental basis.
Adding lime to lakes usually has only a short-term
effect in terms of neutralizing lake acidity. The
longevity of the effect is directly related to lake’s
water residence time, or how long it takes for the lake
volume to be replaced with new water. Another
experimental control is the liming of a lake or stream
watershed. While such an approach can improve forest
health, as well as reduce lake acidity for a more
extended time, it is prohibitively expensive as a widespread
solution to acid deposition.
</p>
</div>

<p><strong>Terrestial Effects</strong></p>

<div>
<p>
The documentation of regional level terrestrial
consequences of acid deposition is complicated. For
example, forested ecosystems in eastern North
America can be influenced by other factors such as
high atmospheric ozone concentrations, drought,
insect outbreaks and disease, sometimes from nonnative
sources. However there is a general consensus
on some impacts of acidic depositon on both soils
and forests in sensitive regions.
</p>

<p>
In the eastern United States, high elevation red
spruce and fir forests found in the Northeast have
suffered significant injury and mortality. Significant
in high elevation spruce-fir forests in the southern
Appalachians. Damage can occur directly to trees. For
example, foliar leaching of plant nutrients such as calcium,
and susceptability to winter cold damage
thought to be the result of exposure to highly acid
cloudwater can be direct impacts. Besides direct
effects, acid deposition on poorly buffered, nutrient
deficient soils has caused the leaching of valuable
plant nutrients such as calcium, magnesium and
other base cations and the release of aluminum,
which can be injurious to plants and, as mentioned
earlier, toxic to aquatic life. The loss of soil base
cations can have long-term deleterious effects and
may delay recovery of stressed ecosystems for
decades or even longer. Such long-term soil nutrient
losses also occur in sensitive low elevation forested
ecosystems.
</p>

<p>
The role of nitrogen in the form of nitrate (NO3
-) from both wet and dry nitric acid deposition can have
both positive and negative effects on ecosystems.
NO3 - is an important plant nutrient and in nitrogenpoor
soils can lead to increased plant growth and
vigor. However in many acid-sensitive soils receiving
high acidic deposition, nitrogen in soils is at or near
saturation and can lead to the leaching of other
important plant nutrients such as base cations or the
release of aluminum into solution. The relative
importance of nitric acid deposition will continue to
grow as substantial reductions in SO2 emissions
occur and emissions of NOx do not appreciably
decline.
