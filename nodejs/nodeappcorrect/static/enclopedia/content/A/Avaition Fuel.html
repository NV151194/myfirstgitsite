AVIATION FUEL
Aviation fuel is the fuel used to power aircraft in
flight. It must satisfy the unique requirements of
both the engine and the airframe of the aircraft.
Currently the great majority (more than 99%) of
aviation fuel used in both civil and military aircraft
is jet fuel. A small quantity of aviation gasoline is
still used in small aircraft. Early aircraft used motor
gasoline to power their spark ignition engines
because the aviation and auto worlds shared the
same early engines. In recognition of aviation’s
more stringent requirements compared to ground
transportation, separate specifications for aviation
gasoline were developed after World War I.
Subsequent aircraft spark ignition engine developments
as World War II approached identified the
need for high octane in aviation fuel for improved
performance. This resulted in the development of
100-octane aviation gasoline and the unique refinery
processes necessary to produce it. Beginning in
the mid-1930s, research was initiated in both Great
Britain and Germany on the development of a gas
turbine aircraft engine, which was radically different
from the spark-ignition, reciprocating engines used
since the days of the Wright brothers. The new jet
engine was capable of markedly improved highspeed
performance. During this development, illuminating
kerosene used as a fuel for lamps, was
chosen as the liquid fuel for the jet engine because
it did not conflict with the very strong military
demand for high-octane aviation gasoline. This use
for jet engines of distillate-based fuels different in
composition from high-octane gasoline has continued
to this day. The first operational use of jetengine-
powered aircraft occurred in a military
aircraft (the German Me-262) late in World War II,
and its performance proved so superior to propellerpowered,
piston-engine aircraft that subsequently
all air forces changed to the use of jet aircraft. The
development and rapid growth of higher-speed
commercial transport aircraft using jet engines
began in the late 1950s. As a result of the switch of
both military and commercial aircraft to jet engines
from spark ignition engines, jet fuel demand rose
rapidly, and jet fuel over time displaced aviation
gasoline as the dominant fuel for aviation use.
FUEL TYPES
Jet fuels in use today are essentially all kerosene-based
but differ somewhat in their compositions. For civil
fuels, Jet A is used primarily in the United States and
Jet A-1 throughout most of the rest of the world. Jet A
and Jet A-1 differ principally in their freezing point,
which is the temperature at which solid wax crystals
form in the liquid fuel as it cools. Commercial aircraft
store their fuel primarily in wing tanks, and there is a
concern that during long international flights through
cold-weather conditions the formation of wax could
interfere with the flow of fuel from the wing tanks into
the engines. Thus all jet fuels specify a freezing point
suitable for its intended flight use. The military fuel
used by both the U.S. Air Force and NATO air forces
is JP-8, which is similar in composition to commercial
Jet A-1, but employs military-designated additives.
The U.S. Navy uses JP-5, a jet fuel with a higher flash
point (a measure of the fire hazard associated with the
fuel) than Jet A, Jet A-1, or JP-8 because of concern
about fire safety aboard aircraft carriers, particularly in
combat operations. In the past the U.S. Air Force used
a very low flash point fuel called JP-4, composed of a
mixture of kerosene and lighter-boiling refinery
streams, but switched to the higher-flash-point
kerosene-based JP-8 fuel to reduce combat losses and
post-crash fire and handling incidents. A commercial
low-flash-point fuel designated Jet B, similar to military
JP-4, is used only in very cold Arctic areas because
of difficulties in starting engines with the more viscous
kerosene-type fuels.
SPECIFICATIONS
Jet fuel requirements are defined by engine and airframe
technical needs, which are balanced against
the need for a widely available and low-cost fuel.
These technical and economic requirements are
translated into fuel specifications that define physical
properties and chemical compositional limits and
that also require the fuel to pass a number of unique
performance tests designed to predict satisfactory
use. Jet fuel is a tightly specified, high-technology
commodity. A number of commercial and military
jet fuel specifications are used throughout the world.
Commercial specifications include ASTM D 1655,
which is an industry consensus specification;
Defense Standard 91/91, issued by U.K. Ministry of
Defense for their Civil Aviation Authority; and the
International Air Transport Association (IATA)
Guidance Material. At major airports, where fueling
systems are operated by a number of different companies
rather than a single company, a combination
of the most stringent requirements of ASTM D
1655, Defense Standard 91/91, and the IATA
Guidance Material called the “Check List” is often
used. Attempts are under way to harmonize the
major commercial Western specifications and to get
non-Western countries to join in using common
worldwide specification and test methods. In addition,
the U.S. military as well as other governments
write specifications for jet fuel.
PROPERTY REQUIREMENTS
Because the jet engine was free of the demanding
need for high-octane fuel, in the early days of the jetengine
development it was thought that it could use
practically any liquid fuel. However, subsequent
experience proved this to be untrue, as a number of
potential problem areas indicated that control of fuel
properties, reflecting both bulk and trace components,
were important for satisfactory use. Over the
years these important property requirements were
translated into specification requirements that put
restrictions on what is acceptable as jet fuel.
During the early jet-engine development work, it
was recognized that the combustion system of the
engine would be a critical component. Fuel-combustion-
related properties are controlled via limits on the
total concentration of aromatic-type compounds as
well as the concentration of condensed ring aromatic
compounds (i.e., naphthalenes). Since these types of
hydrocarbon compounds tend to burn with higher
levels of flame radiation than do other hydrocarbon
compound types, it makes combustor wall cooling
more difficult. In addition, specific combustion performance
prediction tests such, as the smoke point
test and the luminometer number test, were developed
and added to specification requirements. Other
concerns are energy content, density, and volatility.
The minimum energy content of the fuel is specified
for range considerations. The density of the fuel controls
the weight of fuel that can be carried in a given
volume. The volatility or boiling range of the fuel is
controlled because it impacts on a number of properties.
Lower boiling fuels are easier to use, either when
starting a cold engine or when attempting to relight an
engine at altitude, but early attempts to use very light
fuels encountered problems with fuel boiling off from
the vented wing tanks at the low pressure at higher
altitudes. Subsequent experience also demonstrated
the increased safety risks inherent in low-flash-point
fuels in either civil or combat military use.
Specifications include controls on the boiling range of
the fuel as well as a flash point test measurement. The
potential for harmful wax crystal formation in aircraft
wing tanks at low temperatures in flight is controlled
via the inclusion of a freeze point test requirement in
all specifications. The viscosity of the fuel at low temperatures
is limited to ensure the proper operation of
fuel injection nozzles during low-temperature startup.
Problems with the stability of the fuel in storage
leading to unwanted gums and deposit formation
were anticipated in early fuel development work and
led to restrictions on the olefin (unsaturated hydrocarbon)
content of the fuel in specifications.
Subsequent operational experience also discovered
stability problems in flight caused by the exposure of
the jet fuel to hot metal surfaces where reactions of
the fuel with the dissolved oxygen in the fuel led to
deposit formation in critical components such as the
fuel nozzle, heat exchanger surfaces, and narrow-tolerance
moving components in fuel control units.
These high-temperature-thermal stability problems
led to the development of tests designed to simulate
the high-temperature exposure of the fuel, and all
specifications require the fuel to pass such a test.
The use of high-sulfur-content fuels could
enhance undesirable carbon-forming tendencies in
the engine combustion chamber as well as result in
higher amounts of corrosive sulfur oxides in the
combustion gases. Mercaptans (a type of sulfur compound)
cause odor problems and can attack some
fuel system elastomers. Both the concentration of
total sulfur compounds as well as the concentration
of mercaptan sulfur compounds are controlled in
specifications. The corrosivity of the fuel toward
metals caused by the presence of elemental sulfur or
hydrogen sulfide is controlled by the use of tests such
as the copper strip corrosive test. Acidic compounds
present in the fuel, such as organic acids or phenols,
are controlled by a total acidity test.
Another area of importance is contamination. Jet
fuels are tested for the presence of heavier fuel contamination
by use of an existent gum test, which
detects the presence of heavier hydrocarbons from
other products. Testing also is carried out to detect
the presence of excessive levels of undissolved water
and solids, as well as for surfactants that can adversely
affect the ability of filters and coalescers to remove
dirt and water from the fuel.
Additives also are used to enhance jet fuel quality
in a manner similar to that of gasoline, but unlike
gasoline, are tightly controlled. Only additives specifically
cited in a specification can be used within
allowed limits. The mandated or permitted use of
additives varies somewhat in different specifications,
with military fuels tending to the greater use of additives
compared to civil fuels. A static dissipater additive
is used in many fuels to enhance the rapid
dissipation of any electrostatic charge in the fuel created
by the microfiltration used for dirt removal. To
prevent the formation of deleterious hydroperoxides
during prolonged fuel storage, many specifications
require that an antioxidant (a compound that slows
down or prevents oxidation) additive be added to
fuels that have been hydrotreated. This must be done
because the natural antioxidants present in the fuel
that were unavoidably removed.
Another additive used is a metal deactivator to
chemically deactivate any catalytic metals such as
copper accidentally dissolved in the fuel from metal
surfaces. Uless they are chemically deactivated, dissolved
metals cause the loss of good stability quality.
Corrosion inhibitor/lubricity improvement additives
are used particularly in military fuel for the dual
purpose of passivating metal surfaces and improving
the lubricating properties of the fuel in equipment
such as fuel pumps. The military also specifies the use
of a fuel system icing inhibitor as an additive to prevent
filter blocking by ice crystal formation, because
military aircraft tend not to use fuel line filter heaters,
which are standard equipment on civil aircraft.
COMPOSITION AND MANUFACTURING
Aviation turbine fuels are produced in refineries primarily
using petroleum crude oil as the sole starting
material. The exceptions are Canada, which uses
some liquids produced from tar sands, and South
Africa, which uses some liquids produced from coal.
The overwhelming percentage of chemical compounds—
present in jet fuel are hydrocarbon compounds,
that is, compounds composed of carbon and
hydrogen. These hydrocarbon compounds include
branched and normal paraffins; single-ring and multiring
cycloparaffins, which are also called naphthenes;
and single-ring and multiring aromatics,
hydroaromatics, and olefins. The distribution of
hydrocarbon compound types varies considerably,
primarily depending on crude source. Heteroatom
compounds, which are hydrocarbon compounds that
also contain sulfur, nitrogen, or oxygen, are present at
trace levels, and are important because heteroatoms
can have a disproportionate effect on fuel properties.
Much jet fuel is produced by simply distilling a
kerosene fraction from the crude oil followed by some
form of additional processing. The initial boiling
points for the distillation are generally set to produce a
jet fuel that meets the flash-point requirement, and the
final boiling points are set to meet requirements such
as freeze-point, smoke-point or naphthalene content.
Jet fuel often is blended from a number of streams. In
addition to simply distilled kerosene fractions, blend
stocks are produced from heavier crude oil fractions or
refinery product streams by breaking them down into
lower-boiling fractions. The processing steps used to
prepare blend stocks after distillation vary considerably,
depending on factors such as crude oil type,
refinery capabilities, and specification requirements.
Crude oils, whose kerosene fractions are low in total
sulfur content, can be chemically processed to reduce
mercaptan sulfur or organic acid content. For example,
a kerosene with a high organic acid content but a low
total and mercaptan sulfur content can be simply treated
with caustic (sodium hydroxide) to lower the acid
level. Similarly, a jet fuel blend stock low in total sulfur
but too high in mercaptan sulfur can be chemically
treated in a so-called sweetening process, which
converts the odorous mercaptan sulfur compounds
into odor-free disulfide compounds. Chemical treatment
is often followed by passage through both a salt
drier to lower water levels, and a clay adsorption bed to
remove any trace impurities still present.
Another type of processing employed is treatment
in a catalytic unit with hydrogen at elevated temperatures
and pressures. Catalytic processing is used, for
example, when higher total sulfur levels require total
sulfur removal, which cannot be achieved by chemical
treatment. In addition, catalytic treatment with
hydrogen, depending on the process conditions, can
be used to break down heavier fractions into the
kerosene range. More severe processing conditions
such as higher pressures used to affect a boiling point
reduction, will also generally extensively remove heteroatoms
and markedly lower the level of olefins. Jet
fuel normally sells at a premium compared to other
distillates, and reflects the cost of crude oil.
Jet fuel is shipped in a highly complex system
designed to prevent or eliminate excess water, particulates
such as dirt and rust, microbial growths, and
contamination from other products in the fuel being
delivered into aircraft. Transportation may involve
shipment in pipelines, railcars, barges, tankers, and/or
trucks. Techniques employed include dedicated storage
and transportation, the use of filters to remove
particulates, and the use of coalescers and wateradsorbing
media to remove water. The elimination of
water will prevent microbial growth.
ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES
As for all hydrocarbon fuels, the combustion of jet
fuel produces carbon dioxide and water. Turbine
engines are designed to be highly efficient and to
produce low levels of unburned hydrocarbons and
carbon monoxide. Nitrogen oxides and sulfur
oxides also are emitted from the turbine engine.
There is little organic nitrogen in the fuel, and
oxides of nitrogen are produced from the nitrogen
and oxygen in the air during the combustion
process. As a result, control of nitrogen oxides emissions
is essentially an engine combustor design
issue. Sulfur oxides are produced from the low levels 
of sulfur compounds present in jet fuel during
the combustion process, and thus control of sulfur
oxides is essentially a fuel-related issue. Only a
small fraction of all sulfur oxides emissions are produced
by the combustion of jet fuel because of the
relatively low use of jet fuel compared to total fossil-
fuel combustion. However, jet-fuel-produced
sulfur oxides emissions are unique because aircraft
engines are the only source emitting these species
directly into the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere
an issue of growing interest to atmospheric
and climate change researchers.
