APPLIANCES
INTRODUCTION
Appliances refers to a vast array of devices that
account for about 35 percent of overall energy consumption
in the United States. As was pointed out in
an early California Energy Commission hearing
determining the scope of the law that delegated to
that Commission authority to regulate the efficiency
of appliances, Webster’s Unabridged Dictionary (2nd
ed., 1979) defines appliance as “something applied to
a particular use; a device or machine….” This broad
definition allows products that use energy directly or
indirectly for virtually any purpose to be considered
as appliances.
This review adopts the broad perspective, recognizing
that the primary policy mechanisms applied to
improve energy efficiency—minimum efficiency
standards, incentive programs, normative and
informative labeling programs, and technology-driven
market forces—can address a very wide variety of
products.
Examples of products considered appliances under
U.S. federal law, most recently modified by the
Energy Policy Act of 1992, include residential products
such as refrigerators, freezers, clothes washers,
dishwashers, water heaters, heating and cooling
equipment, televisions, computers and their power
supplies, showerheads, toilets, plumbing fittings, and
cooking products. Also considered appliances under
U.S. federal law commercial and industrial appliances
such as air conditioning and heating systems and their
components, water heaters and storage tanks, boilers,
lighting system components such as fluorescent
lamps, ballasts and fixtures, in addition, incandescent
lamps, and motors. These products are involved in
virtually all energy use in the residential and commercial
sectors, which exceeds 35 percent of the U.S.
total, including the upstream effect of electricity consumption.
Excluding motors and lighting, appliance
energy use is about one–fifth of the U.S. total.
Each of these products is different; each uses a different
technology, is subject to different market
forces, different production characteristics, distribution
practices, and pricing systems. Yet, the dominant
trends in energy efficiency, and in the policies used to
affect it, show remarkable similarity across end uses.
For most appliances, substantial efficiency
improvements have taken place over the last thirty
years. Most of these improvements have been responsive
to policy initiatives at the state or federal level,
although in a few cases technology improvements that
were aimed at some other goal also included substantial
energy efficiency improvements as a by-product.
The range of efficiency improvement has varied dramatically,
from reductions of over 75 percent in energy
use of refrigerators that comply with the 2001
Department of Energy standard compared with similiar
(but somewhat smaller) products in 1972, to water
heaters, where current products appear to be no higher
in efficiency than they were in the 1940s.
Energy policies and the progress of technology are
deeply intertwined for appliances. Appliances are sold
to provide a specific energy service, and that service is
the focus of their marketing and promotion as well as
of consumer acceptance. Energy efficiency is not
widely perceived by the marketplace to be important.
Even when the payback period of energy efficiency
investment by the consumer is short, surveys have
shown that energy efficiency is never the first, or
even second or third most important feature determining
consumer choice.
This trend is self-reinforcing in the broader market
and creates a vicious circle. Manufacturers recognize
that the consumer will not accept a product that
costs more to achieve greater energy efficiency, even
if the payback period is as short as three years.
Because of this observation, manufacturers do not
produce high– efficiency options for the consumer
marketplace in sufficient quantities to make their
prices competitive. The consumer, therefore, does
not perceive efficiency as a product differentiation
feature. This reinforces an indifference to energy
efficiency. In recognition of this indifference, policy
interventions—in the form of mandatory efficiency
standards, incentive programs such as rebates for
products meeting specified efficiency levels or competitive
acquisition of products that achieve the highest
cost/efficiency results, bulk purchases of efficient
products, and normative labeling—have led to the
introduction of vastly improved technologies.
Indeed, before widespread government policy
interventions into appliance efficiency, trends in efficiency
were as likely to represent decreases in efficiency
as increases. The same market barriers that
recently have impeded the introduction of new technologies
for efficiency have, in the past, caused products
to be redesigned with new technologies for
lower energy efficiency in order to cut first costs.
Refrigerators declined in efficiency following
World War II due, apparently, to the substitution of
lower-cost, lower-efficiency motors with improved
thermal insulation to protect them from waste heat
generation, and there is some evidence that water
heater efficiency declined between the end of World
War II and 1975, and that industrial dry-type transformers
declined in efficiency between 1970 and 1993.
Energy consumption also can increase through the
introduction of new product features, a process that
should be distinguished from reductions in efficiency.
The move from black and white to color television,
and the introduction of automatic defrost on refrigerators,
are examples of additions of features that compromise
energy conservation. These must be balanced
against other features or technologies, such as electric
components for television and micro-channel heat
exchangers for air conditioners, that improve product
performance while also improving efficiency.
The effects of trends toward lower efficiency and
higher energy-consuming features and the countervailing
force of policy interventions is illustrated in
Figure1, which displays the history of refrigerator
energy consumption.
During the period before 1972, when energy policy
ignored efficiency, energy consumption grew at an
annual rate of about 6 percent. Some of this trend
was due to the introduction of new features such as
automatic defrosting and through-the-door ice service,
some of it was due to increases in product size
and in freezer compartment size, but two percentage
points of the annual growth rate in energy was due to
actual decreases in efficiency.
Following multiple energy policy initiatives of the
post-1973 era, this trend was arrested and energy
consumption began to decline, even as size and features
continued to increase. The effect of the 1979
California efficiency standard is clearly apparent in
the figure. Further inflection points in the curve
appear when California implemented its 1987 standards,
when the 1990 federal standards went into
effect, and particularly when the 1993 amendments
went into effect. In addition, a gradual slope toward
decreasing energy consumption coincided with utility-
sponsored incentive programs whose largest
effects were felt in the mid-1980s and early 1990s.
In sum, for appliances, energy efficiency technology
improvements are not always adopted even after
they become well understood and technology
changes do not necessarily lead to improved energy
efficiency.
