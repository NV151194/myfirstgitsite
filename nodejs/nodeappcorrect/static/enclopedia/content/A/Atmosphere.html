ATMOSPHERE
Man is able to directly utilize only a small portion of
the energy of the Earth’s atmosphere. Indeed, excessive
concentrated energy in the atmosphere—hurricanes
and tornadoes—represents risks to mankind.
Most human demands created by atmospheric conditions
involve consumption of energy to maintain comfort.
The ambient surface air temperature, for
instance, determines how much energy is needed for
heating or cooling demands and the level of outside
ambient illumination determines the need for artificial
lighting. Electricity derived from fossil fuels powers
the industrialized world Petroleum products directly
power most forms of transportation. Pollution emitted
by massive fossil fuel consumption affects man’s wellbeing
and quality of life on both immediate and longterm
time scales, and mitigation this anthropogenic
(manmade) pollution using emission-control devices
requires even greater energy consumption.
ATMOSPHERIC COMPOSITION
Unpolluted air contains about 78 percent molecular
nitrogen, 21 percent molecular oxygen, 1 percent
argon, up to 3 percent water vapor, and a host of trace
gases, including carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide,
methane, nitrous oxide, helium, krypton, and radon.
Oxygen is constantly released to the atmosphere by
green plants during photosynthesis. Plants and animals
excrete carbon dioxide during respiration. Water
evaporates from the surface of the Earth and travels as
a vapor through the atmosphere, eventually condensing
and falling as precipitation. The atmosphereocean-
geosphere and biosphere have maintained a
natural chemical balance over many millennia,
although steadily increasing anthropogenic trace gas
emissions may have the potential to change this natural
balance in the future.
Air pollution is produced by various natural and
anthropogenic sources. Natural sources inject large
amounts of particles into the atmosphere, including
inorganic minerals, pollen, small seeds, bacteria,
fungi, and effluvia from animals, especially insect
parts. These natural particles usually have diameters
greater than 10-5 cm. Many anthropogenic particles
are continuously injected into the atmosphere,
including latex and soot. Particles produced from
combustion generally have diameters smaller than
10-5 cm. Tiny hygroscopic particulates from both
natural and anthropogenic sources play an important
role in the atmosphere, serving as condensation
nuclei for water droplet and ice crystal formation.
The period of time that particles remain in the
atmosphere is influenced by their height and
weight. Small particles in the stratosphere remain
aloft much longer than small particles in the lower
troposphere.
Polluted air often contains carbon monoxide and
volatile organic carbon (VOC) gases, including
ketones and aldehydes, as well as oxides of sulfur and
oxides of nitrogen. Anthropogenic emissions of these
gases arise from incomplete combustion and subsequent
photochemical alterations in the atmosphere.
Anthropogenic emissions also inject a number of relatively
inert gases into the troposphere, including
chlorofluorocarbons, sulfur hexafluoride, and carbon
tetrachloride. Trees have been found to be a major
natural source for VOCs.
Pollutants have various atmospheric residence
times, with reactive gases and large aerosols being
rapidly removed from air. In the London air pollution
episode of December 1952, the residence time
for sulfur dioxide was estimated to be five hours;
daily emissions of an estimated 2,000 tons of sulfur
dioxide were balanced by scavenging by fog droplets,
which were rapidly deposited. Most relatively inert
gases remain in the atmosphere for extended periods.
Sulfur hexafluoride, used extensively in the electric
power industry as an insulator in power breakers
because of its inertness, has an estimated atmospheric
lifetime of 3,200 years.
Emissions from fossil fuel combustion have
caused increasing air pollution problems. Four major
types of problems have been recognized: acid deposition
and acid rain, air pollution episodes involving
sulfur-rich smog from coal burning, photochemical
smogs from gasoline-powered vehicles, and the
threat of global warming as a result of increasing levels
of carbon dioxide (a “greenhouse gas”) in the
atmosphere.
North American and Western European countries
responded to acid rain, acid deposition, and
acidic sulfurous smog episodes (which caused
excess mortality and morbidity as well as greatly
decreased visibility) by passing emission control
laws. Sulfurous smogs are now rare in North
America and Western Europe. Despite emission
controls, acid rain and acid deposition are believed
by many scientists to be the cause of forest decline,
known as “neuartige Waldschäden” in Europe. This
forest decline has been detected throughout Central
Europe at all elevations and on all soil types.
Evidence suggests that nitrates in acid rain play an
important role in Waldschäden. Asian countries
continue to burn fuel with few emission controls. A
few tragic consequences include erosion of the Taj
Mahal by acidic air pollutants, and occasional snootladen
smog blanketing the Indian Ocean north of
the equator.
Photochemical smogs arise worldwide because of
the action of sunlight on emissions from gasolinepowered
vehicles. Decreased visibility, increased
morbidity, and crop damage as a result of photochemical
smogs led to introduction of the catalytic
converter on automobiles in the United States. This
has had only a small impact on the occurrence of
photochemical smogs in the United States.
Global warming has attracted growing worldwide
concern, leading to the Kyoto Accords of 1997,
which agreed that rich industrial nations would
reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Legally binding
reductions for each major greenhouse gas were set,
with emphasis on reducing carbon dioxide emissions
by 2008–2012. The Kyoto Accords were signed by
President Clinton in 1998, with a carbon dioxide
emissions reduction objective of 7 percent for the
United States, although the U.S. Senate failed to ratify
them. China, Brazil, India, and Mexico were
among nations exempted from the Kyoto Accords.
Canada (with an emissions reduction objective of
6%) and the European Union (with an emissions
reduction objective of 8%) have developed (and
implemented) some strategies to reduce carbon
dioxide emissions. Norway has begun a program to
sequester carbon in the ocean.
The concentration of chlorofluorocarbons in the
atmosphere has been steadily increasing since they
began being manufactured. It has been discovered
that chlorofluorocarbons are slowly destroyed by
chemical reactions in the stratosphere, especially
heterogeneous reactions in polar stratospheric
clouds above Antarctica. The chlorine released during
these reactions in turn destroys stratospheric
ozone, the most prominent result being the creation
of the infamous “ozone hole,” a zone with greatly
diminished stratospheric ozone centered over
Antarctica during winter. This ozone depletion
occurs in the winter and early spring—when the
sun’s radiation strikes the Antarctic stratosphere.
Ozone levels recover
Recognition of the threat of stratospheric ozone
depletion posed by chlorofluorocarbons and chlorofluorohydrocarbons
led 131 countries to sign the
Montreal Protocol in 1987. Production of chlorofluorocarbons
was banned as of January 1, 1996,
because of their potential to further deplete stratospheric
ozone. Chlorofluorohydrocarbons will be
phased out of production by 2030; HCFC-22 will be
phased out by 2020. However, large amounts of
chlorofluorocarbon refrigerants produced over
many decades remain in use worldwide, awaiting
future release.
EARTH’S RADIATION BALANCE
Solar radiation continually reaches the earth, warming
the atmosphere, ocean, and land surfaces on the
sunlit portions of the planet. Although the sun emits
a continuous spectrum of electromagnetic energy, its
peak emissions are in the visible wavelengths, with a
maximum at 500 nm wavelength. The average
amount of solar energy received globally at the top of
the atmosphere is relatively constant, about 1,353
W/m2. Clouds and particles reflect some incident
solar radiation back into space. Some large volcanic
eruptions inject copious numbers of particles, which
attenuate solar radiation reaching Earth’s surface.
When a volcanic eruption injects large amounts of
sulfur into the stratosphere, sulfuric acid aerosols
slowly form in the stratosphere, where they remain
for months; these aerosols also reflect incident solar
radiation.
About 51 percent of solar energy incident at the
top of the atmosphere reaches Earth’s surface.
Energetic solar ultraviolet radiation affects the
chemistry of the atmosphere, especially the stratosphere
where, through a series of photochemical
reactions, it is responsible for the creation of ozone
(O3). Ozone in the stratosphere absorbs most of the
short-wave solar ultraviolet (UV) radiation, and
some long-wave infrared radiation. Water vapor and
carbon dioxide in the troposphere also absorb
infrared radiation.
Considerable energy is radiated back from Earth’s
surface into space as long-wave infrared radiation.
The atmosphere absorbs some of this infrared radiation,
preventing its loss to space. This trapping is
sometimes referred to as “the Greenhouse Effect.”
THE HYDROLOGICAL CYCLE
Water is constantly evaporated from rivers, lakes, and
oceans, and released from vegetation through evapotranspiration.
Water vapor travels through the atmosphere,
eventually forming small droplets or ice
crystals in clouds. Some particles grow sufficiently
large, and fall as rain or snow. Most precipitation
occurs over the world’s oceans. Much of the rain and
snow falling over continental areas rapidly runs off
into major river channels, returning water to the
oceans. Some snow is deposited in glaciated areas,
including high mountain peaks on the continents and
on the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets, where it
may remain for millennia. About 75 percent of the
Earth’s fresh water is currently stored in glaciers ice
sheets. Calving of icebergs from the ice sheets and
periodic glacial retreat in major mountain ranges
return some of this long-frozen water to the ocean.
During the summer of 1999, no icebergs were seen to
enter North Atlantic shipping lanes, possibly because
of warmer than usual ocean temperatures.
The balance between evaporation, precipitation,
glaciers, and oceans, known as the hydrological cycle,
is usually considered to be in rough equilibrium over
the Earth, although there is evidence that the
Greenland ice sheet shrank substantially during the
mid-1990s. There is also evidence that the West
Antarctic ice sheet thinned during the same period.
During times of global cooling and glacial advance,
ocean water levels dropped as increasing amounts of
water were stored in ice sheets, as was the case during
the Pleistocene glaciation of Eurasia and America.
At warmer times in the geological record, glaciers
have had dramatic retreats, resulting in a worldwide
rise in ocean levels. The change from a cold period to
a warm period may occur rapidly over the course of a
century. Since 1960, mid-latitude glaciers have receded
dramatically. Glaciers in the Caucasus are estimated
to have lost about half their mass, while the Tien
Shan Mountains are estimated to have lost about 22
percent of their glacial ice between 1960 and 2000.
The decade of the 1990s is believed by most scientists
to have been the warmest in many millennia. It has
been postulated that these changes foreshadow a
more prolonged global warming period that may be
partially attributable to anthropogenic alterations in
atmospheric composition.
TROPICAL STORMS
Solar heating of tropical oceans warms the surface
water, promoting evaporation. Where the equatorial
surface waters are warmest and the northeast and
southeast trade winds meet, a band of cirrostratus and
cirrus clouds spreads out from convective precipitation
regions. This area is known as the Intertropical
Convergence Zone.
When tropical ocean surface water temperatures
exceed 26°C near the edge of the Intertropical
Convergence Zone, and air aloft is warm and moist,
conditions are favorable for the development of large
tropical cyclones. These storms begin as weak
depressions or disturbances, most of which fail to
develop into organized systems. When conditions
favor storm development, pressures drop in the center
and winds increase in a tight 30–60 km band
around a central eye. Large storms are powered by
the latent heat of condensation released as clouds
form from the moisture-laden air.
When a tropical storm has winds in excess of 120
km/hr, it is officially classed as a hurricane. Large
hurricanes have a highly organized rotary structure,
with a central eye surrounded by tightly curving
bands of clouds extending up to 2,000 km in diameter,
although most important activity occurs within
100 km of the eye. Large hurricanes draw enormous
amounts of moisture from the Intertropical
Convergence Zone.
The most powerful hurricanes (called “Category
5”) have sustained winds exceeding 248 km/hr. In
general, hurricanes move slowly with the average
wind speed of the troposphere. When these hurricanes
strike land, they bring a devastating combination
of high winds, torrential rain, and a storm surge.
The storm surge is an uplifting of the water level
resulting from an air pressure drop and wind-driven
water; the most powerful hurricanes have a storm
surge exceeding 18 feet (5.5 m). Hurricane Gilbert, a
massive Category 5 hurricane in 1988, dominated
about 20 percent of the entire global Intertropical
Convergence Zone, causing the cloudiness in the
zone outside the storm to dissipate. Hurricane
Andrew, which devastated South Florida in 1992,
was also a Category 5 hurricane.
As a hurricane travels over warm ocean water, it
lowers the sea surface temperature by about 3°C in a
100 km swath. When a hurricane is stationary, this
surface ocean cooling weakens the storm intensity.
Hurricanes also rapidly lose strength when they
move over cold water or land.
How is energy utilized in a hurricane? Hurricanes
derive energy mainly from the release of latent heat,
and lose energy, in part, through precipitation and
frictional loss of the wind. For an average hurricane,
the rate of release of latent heat has been estimated at
1014 watts. This is equivalent to the energy output of
a 20-megaton bomb every fifteen minutes. An average
hurricane with maximum winds of 50 m/s and a
radius of 30 km dissipates wind energy at a rate of 3 ✕
1012 watts. Thus, it takes only about 3 percent of the
input energy to maintain the destructive winds of an
average hurricane.
THUNDERSTORMS
Thunderstorms (cumulonimbus clouds) come in
many sizes and shapes, ranging from small “air-mass”
thunderstorms to large “supercells.” Thunderstorms
are influenced by the surrounding atmosphere and
nearby convective activity. Sometimes a thunderstorm
is composed of a single, isolated cumulonimbus
cloud. At other times, cumulonimbus clouds are
so numerous that they form a continuous sheet, losing
any separate identity.
The air-mass thunderstorm is the least severe of all
thunderstorms. In its simplest form, an air-mass
thunderstorm grows as a single cell when solar radiation
heats the surface air in an unstable atmosphere.
Its life cycle lasts around 30 minutes. Towering
cumulus clouds are formed as in-cloud updrafts push
moisture upward. The tower may reach a height
about five times the diameter of the cloud base in the
growth phase.
When water vapor is deep enough for continued
convective activity, the thunderstorm reaches an
active phase, in which the top of the cloud glaciates,
often forming a distinctive anvil. Strong updraft and
downdraft regions form within the cumulonimbus
cloud. The change from a towering cumulus cloud to
a cumulonimbus cloud is usually quite rapid as the
top turns to ice, and lightning and heavy rain begin.
The final stage in the life of a cumulonimbus
cloud is marked by dissipation. The lower regions of
the cloud break up, while the upper anvil spreads out.
Mixing with the environment lowers vertical wind
velocities by reducing the in-cloud temperatures
through evaporation and mechanical mixing with the
cooler surrounding air.
Most air mass thunderstorms form in groups,
facilitating growth by the reduction of environmental
mixing. These multicellular storms may occur as
compact clusters of cells or, if there is some external
organization, laterally aligned in squall lines.
Supercells have greater size, organization, and duration
than air mass thunderstorms. A supercell rotates,
with persistent updrafts and downdrafts, and lasts for
many hours. Updrafts in supercells may exceed 140
km/hr. Supercells develop when there are large
changes in wind velocity with height. Moist, warm air
entering from the front side is lifted at the cold air gust
front until condensation occurs, releasing latent energy.
This air parcel then moves rapidly upward and,
usually, out ahead of the storm at upper levels in the
atmosphere. Dry air moves in from the back side of
the supercell, is cooled by rain falling out of the rising
air, and then descends as a downdraft. Several different
arrangements of this flow are possible. Supercells frequently
move slower than the mean winds aloft. These
storms are notorious for their ability to spawn tornadoes;
they may show a tornadic “hook echo” on radar
displays. Supercells and regular cells can combine in a
multicellular complex, which then exhibits some characteristics
of both types of storms.
Thunderstorms arise from convective activity,
driven by energy derived from the latent heat of condensation
and sublimation of water vapor within
cumuliform clouds. Buoyant air movements caused
by surface heating, by orographic (relating to mountains)
forcing, and by lifting of warm moist surface air
along frontal zones, are some of the important mechanisms
for initiating the upward transfer of energy.
TORNADOES
Calculations of tornado energy are difficult to make—
the aftermath of a large destructive tornado sometimes
resembles carpet bombing in a war situation,
with buildings ripped off foundations, large numbers
of trees uprooted, and asphalt stripped from roadways.
Several reports describe the derailment of up to
five train cars as tornadoes have apparently lifted cars
off the tracks. Large building debris has been found at
a distance of 20 km from its original location.
Meteorologists categorize tornadoes by their wind
speeds as deduced subjectively from severity of the
damage. Each tornado is given a Fujita F-scale class: F0
(light damage), 40–72 mph; F1 (moderate damage),
73–112 mph; F2 (considerable damage), 113–157
mph; F3 (severe damage), 158–206 mph; F4 (devastating
damage), 207–260 mph; F5 (incredible damage),
261–318 mph. The highest reported toronto wind
speed (reported from Doppler reader) was 318 mph in
the F5 Oklahoma City tornado of May 3, 1999.
The F-scale classification is only a first approximation
to tornado damage. Some buildings are windsensitive
while others are wind-resistant. The lower
pressure of the tornado core also weakens the integrity
of the building. Mobile homes, wood-frame
houses, buildings with sheet metal roofs, and those
with unreinforced masonry walls are particularly sensitive,
often damaged by winds less than 100 mph. In
rural counties without building codes, wood-frame
houses using nails to anchor walls to foundations can
be blown off and destroyed by 80-mph winds.
Structurally engineered buildings are seldom
destroyed or even severely damaged. People are most
often injured and killed by falling building materials
and by projectiles in the debris suspended in the tornado.
Tornadoes form in several ways. The most common
tornadoes form at the edge of thunderstorm
cold air outflow, and they are called gustnadoes.
Gustnadoes fall into the F0 or F1 class and only rarely
inflict intense damage along a short, narrow path.
Waterspouts and landspouts form in areas where a
pre-existing surface circulation becomes entrained,
stretched, and intensified as a thunderstorm updraft
passes over. Waterspouts and landspouts may attain
in F2 class, and several have been reported to inflict
moderate damage to marinas or poorly constructed
buiildings. The least frequent and most severe tornadoes
form and descend from supercell thunderstorms,
which may persist for many hours and spawn
multiple tornadoes. However, the most severe tornadoes,
although less frequent, are those that descend
from supercells. Supercells may persist for many
hours. A single supercell, moving over several hundred
kilometers, has been observed to spawn a series
or “family” of up to eight tornadoes along its route.
These tornadoes are associated with rotating circulations
called mesocyclones. The mesocyclone is 10 to
20 km in diameter, much bigger than a single torna
do. It can sometimes be seen as a larger-scale rotation
of the clouds at the bottom of the supercell. Rotation
begins at an altitude between 4 km and 8 km and
builds downward. Sometimes a mesocyclone produces
more than one tornado at a time.
An average of 800 tornadoes is reported within the
United States yearly, with possibly 2,000 small tornadoes
going unreported. Tornadoes have been reported
in every state, including Hawaii and Alaska. The Great
Plains has the highest occurrence of damaging tornadoes.
Occasionally, tornadoes occur in outbreaks. The
super-outbreak of April 2 and 4, 1974, had 148 reported
tornadoes in 13 states. Hurricanes can spawn tornadoes;
in 1967, Hurricane Beulah generated 115
reported tornadoes. The majority of tornadoes occur
in late afternoon and evening. However, tornadoes can
form at any time of day or night. Nocturnal tornadoes
are relatively common on the U.S. Gulf Coast.
Television news reporting gives the impression
that people incur substantial risk in tornado-prone
regions, but the likelihood of any particular building
being hit is on the order of once every million years.
LIGHTNING
Within cumulonimbus clouds, precipitation processes
and ambient physical conditions interact to produce
regions of high electrical charge. The
mechanisms by which charge separation occurs in
cumulonimbus clouds are poorly understood by
cloud physicists. Some researchers believe that electrical
charges build in strength when ice pellets fall
through a region of ice crystals and water droplets.
Lightning is the visible manifestation of a plasma
channel. The plasma is very hot, with peak temperatures
greater than 30,000°C, compared to 6,000°C for
the sun. Although the peak current in a lightning
stroke may be as high as 100 kiloamperes, charge
transfer is limited by the brief duration of the flash.
Movement within the plasma is limited; a typical
electron in the lightning channel may move only two
meters. Most of the charge transfer occurs by way of
a continuing current between the strokes comprising
the flash, and by relatively low amplitude currents
following strokes. Usually lightning transfers negative
charge to the ground. However, positively
charged cloud-to-ground lightning also occurs.
After electrical potentials on the order of 300 to
400 kV/m are produced in discrete regions within the
cloud, streamers extend their way forward along the
cloud’s charge gradient in a tree-like structure. When
electrical potentials on the order of 1,000 kV/m
develop, streamers become self-propagating. A plasma
channel then moves toward regions of opposite
charge within the cloud, neutralizing much of the
electric charge within the cloud as it travels through
diffusely charged regions. As the channel tip
advances, it may branch in several directions simultaneously.
If it penetrates into highly charged a region,
a recoil streamer may flow along the channel to the
initiating region.
About 80 percent of lightning channels begin and
end in the cloud. The remaining 20 percent of
streamers extend horizontally into the clear air outside
the cloud. They propagate in a stepwise fashion
called step leaders. Discharges ending in the clear air
are usually highly branched, and generally quite
weak. When a step leader approaches the earth’s surface,
an upward streamer propagates from the ground
toward the channel tip aloft. These plasma channels
intersect at an altitude of about 100 m above the
ground. Completion of the circuit causes an upward
rush of electrons called a return stroke, substantially
increasing the brightness of the luminous plasma
channel. Frequently, a second pulse of energy, the
dart leader, moves smoothly down from the cloud,
following the same path to the ground. Return
strokes may follow the dart leader. Typically, cloudto-
ground flashes have four or more separate strokes.
Capturing electricity from a stray lightning flash is
an intriguing but impractical idea. Presumably,
Benjamin Franklin, in his famous kite experiment,
transferred energy from a lightning flash to a Leyden
jar, a primitive type of battery. A typical lightning
flash has 25 coulombs of charge and 30,000 instantaneous
amps. However, the stroke is very brief; 0.01
seconds. This is only enough energy to power one
100-watt bulb for a few months. One hundred thousand
1,000-ft towers would be needed to capture
lightning energy equivalent to the output of a typical
small power station.
Very powerful lightning discharges, known as
superbolts, are about 100 times more powerful than
the typical lightning stroke. Superbolts are most
common in the wintertime off the coasts of Japan and
the eastern United States. The radius of a superbolt
channel is estimated to be 20 cm, compared to 2 cm
of a typical lightning stroke. Because superbolts are
thought to be rare over land, tapping energy from
them is even more problematic than obtaining energy
from a regular lightning strike.
High-altitude discharges above active thunderstorms
have been studied with cameras that sense
very low light levels. Several distinct, differently colored
phenomena have been identified. Unusual
cloud-to-air discharges from the anvil top upward to
heights of 35 to 50 km (into the stratosphere) are
called “blue jets.” Blue jets propagate upward at about
100 km/sec in a narrow conical or trumpet shape.
Red discharges extending 50 to 95 km upward above
thunderstorm anvils are called “sprites.” Sprites have
widths ranging from 10 km to 50 km, and have been
observed only above large (30,000 km2) multicellular
thunderstorms. “Elves” are very brief (1 msec) red
halos that form at altitudes of 60 to 100 km.
WINDS
Winds arise through a complex interplay of forces. As
Earth rotates around its axis every 24 hours, the
atmosphere moves along with the earth. In the troposphere,
large-scale weather systems, covering
regions of around two million square kilometers,
form an interlocking grid pattern over the globe. The
growth and decay of these large systems produces
day-to-day changes in weather conditions around the
world. Large-scale weather systems develop quickly;
they may double in intensity in a period of 12 to 48
hours. Once formed, these systems decay slowly,
generally halving in intensity in four days.
Temperature swings following frontal passages are
common in North America and Eurasia, but are rare
in the tropics, where differences in cloudiness and
precipitation arise from seasonal variability in thermal
forcing. Poleward from the tropical regions,
extratropical cyclones transform latitudinal temperature
gradients into kinetic energy.
In coastal areas, temperature differences between
the land and the water produce air pressure variations,
creating sea and lake breezes that are superimposed on
the normal winds. These winds vary diurnally and as
a function of cloudiness. During the daytime, winds
blow from the cool sea toward the warm land, while
at night the land becomes cooler than the sea surface,
and the winds blow from land to sea.
On a larger scale, continents produce flows,
known as “monsoon winds,” over wide areas
between the surrounding seas and lands. These
winds respond to seasonal forcing. The best example
is the Indian monsoon. During the summer monsoon,
from June through September, moist winds
blow northward off the Indian Ocean. Convergence
of this moist air with other air masses produces
intense precipitation. The monsoon slowly moves
northward in spring and summer, traveling about 5
km/day. From December through February, the
Siberian high dominates Eurasian air circulation, and
the general flow of air is reversed, with cold, dry air
traveling from the continental land masses southward
over the warmer surface waters of the Indian Ocean.
Topography can substantially change air flow.
Local mountain winds form when surface heating
causes winds to flow up the sides of the mountain:
technically known as “anabatic flow.” Anabatic winds
are generally strongest in early afternoon. At night,
winds flow down off hills or mountains, technically
known as “katabatic flow.” In hilly terrain, with
slopes of about two degrees, winds on the order of 3
km/hr descend as the ground surface cools.
Mountains modify the velocity and direction of
wind. The coastal mountains along western North,
Central, and South America play a major role in
determining regional winds on the eastern rim of the
Pacific Ocean. Dynamically induced winds may
attain substantial speeds in mountainous regions,
sometimes exceeding 100 km/hr. Some orographic
winds have been given names associated with a specific
region, such as the “Santa Ana” winds that occur
as dry continental air descends from the Sierra
Nevada Mountains to Southern California coastal
areas during spring and autumn. A strong, warm
wind on the leeward side of a mountain range is
called a chinook (North America) or föhn (Europe).
Strong chinooks, with damaging winds reaching 160
km/hr, occur several times each winter along the
Front Range of the Rocky Mountains.
WIND ENERGY EXPLOITATION
Wind turbines produce power by converting the force
of the wind into torque. The power produced is a
function of the wind energy flux (power), which, in
turn, is a function of the air density multiplied by the
wind velocity raised to the third power. Changes of air
density with time at a particular site are negligible
compared to the fluctuations in wind velocity.
Meteorologists usually report wind speed as an average.
To get the potential wind power, the average
wind speed is raised to the third power and then
adjusted using a Weibull statistical distribution too
account for the natural instantaneous wind variability.
Wind speed, and thus available wind power, at any
given location is a function of several factors: global
variations; local variations, especially around coast
lines with sea or lake breezes and topography; and
diurnal variations of wind speed from differences in
the stability of the air next to the ground. Turbulence
associated with unstable air during the afternoon, or
on cloudy days, mixes higher velocity winds aloft
with the winds slowed by friction at the surface. On
clear nights the air is stable, and there is little transport
of the high winds aloft to the ground. Thus,
wind speeds near the ground are normally higher
during the daytime than at night, with the highest
wind speeds occurring in the afternoon, and minimum
wind speeds around dusk and dawn. In general,
gusts are greatest in the afternoon.
Wind speed varies with height above the ground.
Because surface wind speeds are routinely measured
at 10 m, winds turbine heights (usually higher than
10 m) must be estimated. The turbulence level of
wind also varies. Forests, buildings, and other obstacles
slow wind down, and increase turbulence levels.
Long grass, shrubs, and crops can slow the wind considerably.
Such variations can be corrected by use of
“roughness classes” or “roughness lengths.” The sea
is assigned a roughness class of zero, while a landscape
with many trees and buildings has a class of
three or four. (Sheep can keep the roughness down
through grazing.) When no data are available for a
site, a wind rose from the nearest observations may
provide a rough estimate of wind speed. However,
data availability frequently is sparse in areas with substantial
wind generation potential.
During the late 1970s and early 1980s, there was
considerable interest in harnessing wind energy in the
United States. During this time, efforts were made to
determine the national wind energy potential. Maps
were drawn using the “Batelle Wind Power Classes,”
ranking nominal wind energy at 10 m, 30 m, and 50
m elevations. These classes, which remain standard in
mapping wind energy, are shown on the map. In general,
Class 4 and higher winds are considered favorable
for wind energy exploitation in the United States.
Because of its large population and the tacit
assumption that its varied topography would be ideal
for wind power exploitation, California conducted its
own program to determine wind energy potential.
This study demonstrated the meteorological difficulties
in characterizing wind speeds in hilly terrain.
Some wind turbines were constructed in areas
thought to be ideal, but which proved to be quite
marginal. Three California passes were identified as
among the best wind energy sites in the world, with
average wind speeds in excess of 8 m/s. Tehachapi
and San Gorgonio have proven successful, and the
Altamount Pass wind farm has over 7,500 wind turbines
in operation.
Within the United States, some areas are especially
suited for wind power generation, including North
and South Dakota, Minnesota, Montana, Wyoming,
the Front Range of the Rocky Mountains, the Cascade
Mountains, the Great Lakes shoreline, and the ridge
crests and peaks of the Appalachians. Close examination
of specific geographical and topographical features
may help wind power planners identify suitable sites.
This has proven to be the case for Buffalo Ridge, a
100-km long ridge stretching from Spirit Lake, Iowa,
