AMPÈRE,
ANDRÉ-MARIE
(1775–1836)
André-Marie Ampère was born in Lyons, France,
the son of a wealthy merchant. Ampère’s education
was determined by his father, Jean-Jacques, who
followed Jean Jacques Rousseau’s theories of education.
Ampère was left to educate himself, as his
inclinations dictated, among the books of his
father’s extensive library. At an early age Ampère
discovered a talent for mathematics, working out
the early books of Euclid by himself. On finding
that some of the books he wished to consult in the
library in Lyons were in Latin, he taught himself the
language. Ampère’s mother was a devout Catholic,
who ensured he was thoroughly instructed in the
faith.
Ampère’s domestic life was beset with tragedy. In
1787 the French Revolution began; Jean-Jacques
assumed the post of Juge de Paix, a role with considerable
police powers. When Lyons fell to the
troops of the Republic in 1793, Jean-Jacques was
tried and guillotined. In 1799 Ampère married, supporting
his wife by teaching mathematics in Lyons,
where their son was born the next year. Weakened
by childbirth, his wife died in 1803. Ampère moved
to Paris and took a post in mathematics at the École
Polytechnique. In 1806 he remarried, but this union
was ill-advised. After the birth of a daughter, his
wife and mother-in-law made life for Ampère so
unbearable that he was forced to seek a divorce.
Ampère persuaded his mother and sister to come to
Paris and take charge of his household. Ampère’s
expectations of his children were never realized, and
in domestic life he faced constant money problems.
In 1808 Ampère was named Inspector General of
the newly formed university system, a post he held
until his death. In 1824 Ampère was elected to the
Chair of Experimental Physics at the Collège de
France.
As a deeply religious person whose personal life
was beset by a series of calamities, Ampère searched
in the field of science for certainty. He constructed a
philosophy that enabled him to retain a belief in the
existence of both God and an objective natural world.
Ampère’s philosophy contained two levels of knowledge 
of the external world. There are phenomena
witnessed through the senses, and the objective
causes of phenomena—noumena—that can only be
apprehended through intellectual intuition.
Although Ampère’s philosophical system was the one
continuing intellectual passion of his life, he also
devoted himself to other fields of scientific research.
From 1800 to around 1814, mathematics was
Ampère’s primary interest, with his spare time spent
in chemical investigations. From 1820 to 1827 he carried
out the scientific work for which he is best
known, pioneering the science of electrodynamics.
In 1820 Hans Christian Oersted discovered electromagnetism.
A report of Oersted’s work was delivered
before a sceptical meeting of the Académie des
Sciences held on September 4, 1820. Oersted’s work
was contrary to established ideas, based on
Coulomb’s work of the 1780s, that there could not be
any interaction between electricity and magnetism.
Ampère however, immediately accepted Oersted’s
discovery, and set to work, reading his first paper on
the subject to the Académie on September 18, 1820.
Oersted’s discovery suggested to Ampère, that two
wires, each conducting current, might effect one
another. Deducing the pattern of magnetic force
around a current carrying wire to be circular, Ampère
went on to visualize the resultant force if the wire
were coiled into a helix. One week later Ampère
announced to the Académie, his discovery of the
mutual attraction and repulsion of two helices. In
doing so Ampère presented a new theory of magnetism
as electricity in motion.
Ampère’s researches followed his own philosophy
on the nature of science and scientific explanation.
The phenomenon of electromagnetism had been discovered
by Oersted, and the relationship between
two current-carrying wires by Ampère; what
remained was the discovery of the noumenal causes
of the phenomenon. In his first memoir on electodyamics
Ampère investigated the phenomenon and
provided factual evidence to show that magnetism
was electricity in motion. He concluded that two
electric currents attract one another when moving
parallel to one another in the same direction; they
repel each other when they are parallel but in opposite
directions. Ampère felt that electrical phenomena
could be explained in terms of two fluids, a positive
one flowing in one direction and a negative fluid
going in the other.
In 1820 Ampère described the magnetism of a needle
placed within a helical coil. With the assistance of
Augustin Fresnel, Ampère unsuccessfully attempted
to reverse the procedure by wrapping a coil around a
permanent magnet. They did not investigate the
effect of moving the magnet within the coil. If magnetism
is only electricity in motion, then, Ampère
argued, there must be currents of electricity flowing
through ordinary bar magnets. It was Fresnel who
pointed out the flaw in Ampère’s noumenal explanation.
Since iron was not a good conductor of electricity,
there should be some heat generated, but
magnets are not noticeably hot. In a letter to Ampère,
Fresnel wrote, since nothing was known about the
physics of molecules, why not assume that currents
of electricity move around each molecule. Ampère
immediately accepted the suggestion, assuming each
molecule to be traversed by a closed electric current
free to move around its center. The coercive force,
which is low in soft iron, but considerable in steel,
opposes this motion and holds them in any position
in which they happen to be. Magnetism consists in
giving these molecular currents a parallel direction;
the more parallel the direction, the stronger the magnet.
Ampère did not say why molecules should act
this way, but it was sufficient that this electrodynamic
model provided a noumenal foundation for electrodynamic
phenomena.
In 1821 Michael Faraday sent Ampère details of
his memoir on rotary effects, provoking Ampère to
consider why linear conductors tended to follow circular
paths. Ampère built a device where a conductor
rotated around a permanent magnet, and in 1822
used electric currents to make a bar magnet spin.
Ampère spent the years from 1821 to 1825 investigating
the relationship between the phenomena and
devising a mathematical model, publishing his results
in 1827. Ampère described the laws of action of electric
currents and presented a mathematical formula
for the force between two currents. However, not
everyone accepted the electrodynamic molecule theory
for the electrodynamic molecule. Faraday felt
there was no evidence for Ampère’s assumptions and
even in France the electrodynamic molecule was
viewed with skepticism. It was accepted, however, by
Wilhelm Weber and became the basis of his theory of
electromagnetism.
After 1827 Ampère’s scientific work declined
sharply; with failing health and family concerns, he
turned to completing his essay on the philosophy of
science. In 1836 Ampère died alone in Marseilles
during a tour of inspection.
