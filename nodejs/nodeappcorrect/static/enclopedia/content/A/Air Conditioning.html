AIR CONDITIONING
Air conditioning is the treatment of air to control
simultaneously its temperature, humidity, cleanliness,
and distribution to meet the requirements of a
conditioned space. Common use of the term “air
conditioning” applies it to the cooling of air; however,
true air conditioning treats all aspects of indoor
atmospheric comfort.
An air conditioning system uses an assembly of
equipment to treat air. Normally the assembly
includes a heating system for modifying winter
indoor temperature and humidity; a refrigeration system
for modifying summer temperature and humidity,
a means to maintain indoor air quality (i.e., air
filters and fresh air intake); a method of distribution
of conditioned air; and a control system, such as a
thermostat, to maintain desired comfort conditions.
Air conditioning systems fall into two broad classes.
Comfort air conditioning, which accounts for
most applications, is used to modify and maintain the
indoor environment for habitation. Process air conditioning
is the modification of the indoor environment
to enhance an industrial or a scientific process.
Most air conditioning systems utilize a vaporcompression
refrigeration system (Figure 1) to transfer
the indoor heat to a suitable heat sink such as the
outdoors. Vapor-compression refrigeration systems
employ a cycle in which a volatile liquid, the refrigerant,
is vaporized, compressed, liquefied, and expanded
continuously in an enclosed system. A compressor
serves as a pump, pressurizing the refrigerant and circulating
it through the system. Pressurized refrigerant
is liquefied in a condenser, liberating heat. Liquid
refrigerant passes through an expansion device into
an evaporator where it boils and expands into a vapor,
absorbing heat in the process.
Some air conditioning systems use an absorption
refrigeration system (Figure 2). Absorption refrigeration
systems work by evaporating refrigerant in an
evaporator, with the refrigerant vapor then absorbed
by an absorbent medium, from which it is subsequently
expelled by heating in a generator and
changed back into liquid in a condenser. Absorption
systems may use a pump to help circulate the refrigerant.
The most common absorption systems used
for air conditioning use water as an absorbent and
ammonia as a refrigerant or lithium bromide salt as
an absorber and water as a refrigerant.
For heating purposes, most air conditioning systems
use fossil-fueled furnaces to heat air, or boilers
to heat water or produce steam. Forced air systems
use a blower fan and ductwork to distribute conditioned
air to points of use. Air quality is enhanced in
forced-air systems through the use of filters. The
filters are normally placed in the return air, just
before the heating and cooling components.
Provision may be made for fresh outdoor air to be
added to recirculated room air. A hydronic heating
system uses hot water to convey heat from a boiler
to radiators, convectors, or wall and floor panel
coils. Most steam heating systems use boiler-produced
steam to heat buildings via radiators, convectors,
or heating coils placed in ductwork. Heating
systems may employ humidifiers in winter to
counter the drying effect of heated air, particularly
in forced-air systems.
Summer comfort cooling can increase electrical
loads as much as 50 percent over average consump-
tion. The most uncomfortable summer days, those
with both high temperature and high relative humidity,
increase both sensible and latent system load. The
sensible load increases because the difference
between indoor and outdoor temperature is greater,
requiring the cooling system to move heat to a higher
level. The latent load increases as humidity rises,
since the cooling system must extract more moisture
from the air.
Many air conditioning systems use simple thermostats
to cycle equipment; however, more sophisticated
control systems employing electronics and
microprocessors can reduce energy consumption.
Automotive air conditioning systems provide simple
heating and cooling/dehumidification functions.
There is no provision for filtration of the air. All current
automotive air conditioning utilizes vaporcompression
refrigeration systems coupled to the
automobile’s engine.
Air conditioning systems are categorized by the
method used to control cooling or heating in a conditioned
space. They are further described based on
their terminal cooling or heating media. The most
common type for cooling is the refrigerant based
all-air system which uses a refrigeration cycle to
transfer heat from indoor air to outdoor air with
heat exchangers commonly called coils. Most heating
systems in residences and small buildings are
all-air-using fossil-fueled furnaces. Hydronic (hot
water) or steam heating systems also are common,
particularly in large buildings. Many systems
employ unitary equipment—that is, they consist of
one or more factory-built modules. Larger buildings
may require built-up systems made of various system
components that require engineering design
tailored for the specific building. Sometimes multiple
unitary units are used in large buildings for ease
of zone control where the building is divided into
smaller areas that have their own thermostats controlling
that space.
Selection of air conditioning equipment depends
on balancing various criteria, including performance,
capacity, special requirements, initial and continuing
operating costs; reliability; flexibility and maintainability.
Air conditioning systems have been traditionally
compared and rated by cooling and/or heating capacity
and, more recently, energy efficiency. Capacity is
expressed in British thermal units per hour (Btuh) or
in watts. Energy efficiency is expressed as the operating
efficiency using the term “energy efficiency ratio”
(EER). In the U.S. EER is expressed as British thermal
units per hour per watt (Btuh/w). For window
air conditioners, an energy usage label is required by
the 1975 Energy Policy and Conservation Act.
Unitary air conditioners are rated at operating conditions
standardized by the Air Conditioning and
Refrigeration Institute (ARI). Standard ratings provide
the consumer comparisons between competing
models. This information is published annually in
ARI’s Unitary Directory.
Higher EERs in air conditioning equipment are
not the sole answer to reducing energy consumption.
Proper sizing, reduction of building air leakage,
increasing insulation, reducing unnecessary internal
energy usage, proper conditioned air distribution, use
of night temperature setback or increase, and proper
maintenance of equipment can be greater contribute
factors for reducing energy cost. For example, a properly
sized low-efficiency system operating in a wellsealed
and insulated building can consume less
energy than a high-efficiency system in a poorly insulated
building with lots of outside air infiltration
from poorly fitting windows and doors.
HISTORY
The invention of air conditioning is actually a progression
of the applied ideas of many individuals starting in
the early nineteenth century and dramatically accelerating
in the twentieth century. Most air conditioning
developments occurred in the twentieth century.
Because of the limitations of energy sources and
the technology to top that energy, mechanical air
conditioning was not a practical possibility until the
dawn of the Scientific Age and the Industrial
Revolution. In 1813, Sir John Leslie of England made
one of the earliest proposals to use artificial cooling
for human comfort. Jean Frederic Marquis de
Chabannes followed in 1815 with a British patent for
use of a centrifugal fan to force heated or cooled air
through ducts to rooms. The major breakthrough
came in 1834 when Jacob Perkins invented the vapor
compression refrigeration system, making it possible
to cool air mechanically. David Boswell Reid
designed the first building air conditioning system,
using water sprays, for the British Houses of
Parliament in about 1836.
In the United States, Dr. John Gorrie, unaware of
the work of Perkins, proposed that mechanical
refrigeration be used for comfort cooling, and he
constructed mechanical systems for cooling his
patients at his home in Florida in about 1842.
Although limited experiments, such as Gorrie’s
were being conducted, there was little understanding
of the science involved in cooling and dehumidification.
The first engineering textbook for heating and
cooling, Guide to Calculating and Design of
Ventilating and Heating Installations by Hermann
Rietschel, was published in Germany in 1894.
Rietschel’s chapter on room cooling was the earliest
comprehensive example of a real scientific approach
to comfort cooling.
Rietschel’s engineered approach was introduced in
the United States by consulting engineer Alfred Wolff,
who designed the first modern energy-saving air conditioning
system for the New York Stock Exchange in
1901. Wolff’s huge system used waste steam from the
building power plant to power an absorption-type
refrigeration system to provide comfort cooling. The
fact that the system used steam that would have been
thrown away meant that the energy needed for the
cooling plant was free! The system operated successfully
for twenty years. Wolff designed several other
comfort cooling systems for large buildings before his
death in 1909.
Textile engineer Stuart Cramer first published the
term “air conditioning” in 1906, and G. B. Wilson
defined air conditioning as the control of temperature,
humidity, and air quality in 1908.
Process or industrial air conditioning was proposed,
and a few examples installed, by the late nineteenth
century. Willis Haviland Carrier devoted his
engineering career to air conditioning, catering to
industrial needs beginning in 1902. Carrier took an
engineering, scientific, and business approach to air
conditioning, becoming its greatest early-twentiethcentury
practitioner. Carrier patented dewpoint control,
used for precise humidity control, in 1907. At
about the same time, Carrier devised a psychrometric
chart for calculating air conditions, which became an
essential engineering tool in use to this day. He
founded the first design and manufacturing company
exclusively devoted to air conditioning. In the 1920s
Carrier expanded his interest to comfort cooling.
Before the twentieth century, few homes or public
venues experienced mechanical comfort cooling. A
curious public was exposed enmasse to the pleasures
of summer cooling at the Louisiana Purchase
Exposition in St. Louis in 1904, where the Missouri
State Building had an air conditioned amphitheater.
A hospital in Boston had air conditioned wards in
1906. Some hotels installed cooling systems for lobbies,
meeting halls, and restaurants after 1907.
Motion picture theaters began to install mechanical
comfort cooling systems after 1915.
Air conditioned theaters produced a two-pronged
demand for comfort cooling. Consumers liked it,
asked for it, and patronized those theaters offering it.
Increased attendance at cooled theaters showed that
the installation and operating costs were worthwhile
expenditures, causing more theater owners to decide
to purchase comfort cooling systems.
The aforementioned applications of air conditioning
were possible because a commercial advantage
was present. Limited refrigeration technology contributed
to high installation costs. These costs could
be reduced by using ice instead of mechanical refrigeration,
however, ice-type systems did not dehumidify
as well, and could present higher operation costs,
dependent upon the cost of ice. Still, it often paid to
incur the costs of air conditioning where a commercial
advantage was present.
A commercial advantage was present in many
industrial processes. Uncontrolled heat and humidity
impacted some products such as chocolate, pasta,
textiles, and tobacco. Air conditioning allowed for
uniform and continuous production despite weather
conditions, reduced spoilage and waste, and thus
saved money—enough in many cases to easily justify
the installed and operating costs.
Thus, most of the uses of air conditioning before
the 1930s concentrated on applications that had a
viable financial payback. There was no obvious financial
advantage in air conditioning homes, and this
branch of air conditioning developed later. Home air
conditioning passed from luxury to necessity only
when the installed cost decreased and when air conditioning
systems became worry-free.
The perfection of the electric household mechanical
refrigerator by the 1930s provided a technology
applicable to home air conditioning. This technology
allowed mass production of lower cost, reliable package
air conditioners for homes. It was no accident
that the first room cooler was introduced by the
major refrigerator manufacturer, Frigidaire, in 1929,
followed swiftly by others such as General Electric,
Kelvinator, and Westinghouse. These early package
air conditioners were not central systems and thus
were applicable to homes and small commercial
establishments without any modification of an existing
heating system. These simple cooling devices,
forerunners of the window air conditioners introduced
in the late 1930s, were the beginnings of
affordable air conditioning.
Central air conditioning systems for homes were
available in the early 1930s from several manufacturers
(Figure 3). These were combined with automatic
fossil-fueled heating systems, a new innovation of the
time. Reliable, thermostatically controlled automatic
oil, gas, or coal-firing systems had only become available
after the late 1920s. Before that, most homes and
buildings had used coal that was hand-fired in all but
the largest installations.
The safety of refrigeration and air cooling systems
had always been an issue due to the toxicity or flammability
of most refrigerants. In fact, increasing prevalence
of refrigeration caused accidents and deaths, and
the bad publicity and restrictive legislation were
becoming serious threats to the growth of refrigeration
and air conditioning. Fortunately, a solution was
found when Thomas Midgley, Albert Henne, and
Robert McNary invented chlorofluorocarbon refrigerants
(CFCs) for Frigidaire. They were introduced in
1930 and, with the realization of their overall importance
to health, safety, and the future of refrigeration
and air conditioning, CFCs were made available to the
entire industry. The CFCs made it possible to engineer
air conditioning systems for any application without
fear of safety issues. All other refrigerants used for
small refrigeration and most air conditioning systems
were soon completely displaced. The CFC refrigerants
were applied to air conditioning systems in the
early 1930s. One early use was in air conditioning for
passenger trains. By 1936 all long-distance dining and
sleeping cars on U.S. railroads were air conditioned.
Most homes were not air conditioned by the
1940s, and the costs involved in installing air conditioning
in existing homes were prohibitive until the
window air conditioner was introduced. By the late
1940s the cost and reliability of a window air condieoe tioner were such that middle-class homeowners
could afford them. Sales rocketed from about 50,000
in 1946 to more than 1 million in 1953. The window
air conditioner has become so relatively inexpensive
that it ceased to be a luxury. Sixteen million window
air conditioners were manufactured in 1992. The
experience of window air conditioned homes no
doubt played a part in later demand for centrally air
conditioned homes as homeowners moved on to
newer homes. The window air conditioner, combined
with automatic central heating, now made it
possible to live, work, and play indoors oblivious to
the environment outside. In fact, the ability to control
the indoor environment so effectively is credited
with helping to reverse population migration out of
the southern United States after 1960.
Automotive air conditioning systems using vapor
compression refrigeration systems and CFC refriger-
ants were proposed in 1932 and debuted in the late
1930s, but system problems retarded its popularity
until the 1950s. Auto air conditioning soared in the
1960s; for example, American car installations tripled
between 1961 and 1964.
By the 1960s, central residential air conditioning
was becoming increasingly popular. Equipment had
developed to the point that a number of manufacturers
were producing and marketing unitary air conditioning
equipment. Most new homes were designed
to include central air conditioning. This was true of
commercial buildings also. In fact, the use of air conditioning
changed architectural design. By removing
all environmental restraints, air conditioning made it
possible to design almost any type of building.
Hollow ventilation cores were no longer necessary,
and the “windowless” building made its debut.
Residential construction changed too. Deep porches
for shading were no longer necessary, and a home site
was no longer dependent on prevailing summer
breezes.
During the 1960s, air conditioning system control
began to shift from simple electrical or pneumatic
control to electronic and rudimentary computer control.
This new technology was applied to commercial,
institutional and commercial buildings where
the high cost and complicated nature justified its use.
The oil embargo of the early 1970s gave impetus
to increasing energy efficiency. Manufacturers and
designers responded by developing and using higher-
efficiency compressors for cooling. Condenser
size was increased to lower system pressures, resulting
in energy savings. Heating boilers and furnaces
were redesigned for higher efficiencies. Building
construction methods were revised to include more
insulation and to reduce outside air infiltration.
Existing buildings were scrutinized for energy inefficiencies.
Some building owners went to the
extreme of closing up outside air intakes; the unintended
effect being stale building air and occupant
complaints.
Overall efficiency of air conditioning equipment
steadily rose starting in the mid-1970s, attributed to
consumer demand, government mandate, and incentive
programs. For example, the average efficiency, as
expressed in seasonal energy efficiency ratio, of new
central air conditioners increased about 35 percent
between 1976 and 1991. After national standards took
effect in 1992, efficiency has increased as much as
another 15 percent.
Increased system efficiency has resulted in higher
equipment costs but lower operating costs. A higher
initial cost for equipment can often be justified by the
monetary savings from lower energy consumption
over the life of the equipment.
CFC PHASEOUT
The air conditioning industry was challenged to reinvent
one of its vital system components, refrigerants,
when CFCs were targeted as a prime cause of highlevel
atmospheric ozone depletion. Ozone, an active
form of oxygen, is present in the upper atmosphere.
One of its functions is to filter out solar ultraviolet
radiation, preventing dangerous levels from reaching
the ground.
A hypothesis that halocarbons, including CFCs,
diffused into the upper atmosphere, could break
down, and an ozone-destroying catalytic reaction
could result, was published in 1974. Computer modeling
of the hypothesis showed that such destruction
could happen. The resulting increase in UV radiation
would have adverse health and biological system consequences.
This scenario so alarmed nations that various
measures to control CFC emissions were
undertaken. Although there were scientific uncertainties
concerning the depletion hypothesis, the
United States became the first nation to ban
nonessential CFC use in aerosol sprays, in 1978.
Other nations followed with various control measures,
but CFCs were also widely used as refrigerants,
fire-extinguishing agents, insulation components,
and solvents. The UN Environment Program began
working on a worldwide CFC control scenario in
1981, culminating in the Montreal Protocol of 1987
which called for a phaseout of CFC production over
time. In the United States, an excise tax on CFCs was
passed, steadily increasing year by year so as to make
CFCs increasingly more costly to use. As a result of
various measures, CFC consumption by 1999 had
decreased more than 50 percent.
Phaseout of the CFC refrigerants posed a challenge
for the refrigeration and air conditioning
industries. If the primary refrigerants in use were to
be replaced, what was to be used instead? Some previously
used refrigerants, such as hydrocarbons and
ammonia, were proposed; however, safety and litigation
fears eliminated them from serious consideration.
The producers of CFCs, pursuing their vested
interest, conducted extensive research, resulting in a
number of alternative refrigerants that are widely
accepted today. These alternatives do not contain
chlorine, the element responsible for the ozonedepleting
reaction.
Replacement of halocarbon refrigerants has
increased the cost of refrigeration and air conditioning
systems since the new refrigerants are more costly,
system components need to be redesigned for the
new refrigerants, and service and installation are
more complicated. For example, most refrigeration
and air conditioning systems used one of four refrigerants
before 1987, but now there are more than a
dozen alternatives.
RECENT TRENDS IN AIR CONDITIONING
Energy efficiency had always been a goal of building
owners simply because they were trying to reduce
operating costs. Sometimes there was a trade-off in
personal comfort. Today’s emphasis on energy conservation
also must consider a balance of comfort in
all forms: temperature and humidity control, and
indoor air quality. Air conditioning engineers now
have awareness that energy must be saved, but at the
same time reasonable comfort, and therefore productivity,
must be maintained. Modern air conditioning
system and equipment design coupled with responsible
building architecture have resulted in indoor
environments that minimize the trade-offs. The percentage
of new homes built with central air conditioning
increased from 45 percent in 1975 to 80
percent in 1995. As of 1997, 41 percent of all U.S.
households used central air conditioning, and an
additional 30 percent used room air conditioners. By
1990, 94 percent of new cars sold in the United States
had air conditioning systems.
The trend has been toward progressively higher
energy efficiencies. Per-capita end-use energy consumption
began decreasing in the early 1970s and has
trended downward ever since. National minimum
efficiency requirements for room and central air conditioners
were enacted through the National
Appliance Energy Conservation Act (NEACA) in
1987. The requirements took effect in 1990 for room
units and in 1992 for central air conditioners.
For air conditioning systems used in commercial
buildings, minimal efficiency targets are published
in the form of Standards by the American Society
of Heating, Refrigerating and Air Conditioning
Engineers (ASHRAE). These standards influenced
building energy codes and legislated minimum standards
included in the U.S. Energy Policy Act of 1992.
ASHRAE, in addition to developing standards for
design of equipment, publishes the most comprehensive
air conditioning design and application information
in their Handbook, published annually.
Several innovations have contributed to more efficient
and comfortable air conditioning. In large buildings,
indoor environmental conditions can be
determined and even corrected from a central, computer-
controlled console. Programmable, microprocessor
control systems are seeing increasing use in
large buildings, and their cost is decreasing, improving
the probability that they will be used in residences.
Microprocessors permit design of air conditioning
systems that can respond to occupant and building
needs at a scale only dreamed of before. Direct digital
control of conditioned air outlets permits buildings to
be divided into mini zones. The result is customized
energy use to match the zone’s needs.
Motion detectors and daylight detectors reduce
artificial lighting use, reducing summer cooling
loads.
Variable-speed fan drives permit conditioned air
distribution to be matched more closely to a building’s
needs. High-efficiency electric motors are used
to drive the fans, saving as much as half the energy
once used. Both variable-speed and high- efficiency
motors are being applied even in residential air conditioning
systems.
New compressor technology employing rotary
scroll-type compressors is replacing previously used
reciprocating technology. Scroll compressors operate
at higher efficiencies over wider operating conditions.
Electrical and electronic technology are making variable-
capacity compressors cost-effective for the twenty-
first century. Compressor performance can be
optimized for a wider operation range, and matching
compressor capacity to the actual demand for cooling
increases the system efficiency, saving energy.
Thermal storage is being used to reduce energy
needs. Cooling systems are being designed to “store”
cooling at night, when energy cost and consumption
may be lower, and release the stored cooling during
the day. Building design itself has begun to change so
the energy storage capability of the building mass itself
can be used. Shading and “low e” glass is being used to
reduce heat gains and losses through windows.
Energy recovery ventilators, which move energy
between outgoing stale building air and incoming
fresh air, are being used to improve indoor air quality
without large increases in energy consumption.
Cooling systems that use refrigeration systems to
cool and partially dehumidify air are being combined
with desiccant dehumidification to reduce energy
costs. Dessicant systems use a regenerable moisture
absorbant to extract humidity from the air to be conditioned.
Saturated absorbant is exposed to a higher
air temperature, releasing the absorbed moisture.
The absorbant is then recycled. Some systems use
rotating wheels to continuously recycle the
absorbant. Absorption-type refrigeration systems are
used in these hybrid systems where the waste heat
can be used to continuously regenerate the desiccant.
Research continues in both industry and government
to find ways to innovate and improve air conditioning
systems. For example, ASHRAE maintains an
ongoing research program covering energy conservaeoe
tion, indoor air quality, refrigerants and environmentally
safe materials. The society’s journal maintains an
HVAC&R search engine on the Internet covering
more than 700 related web sites. In addition, the U.S.
Department of Energy funds research and development
on advanced air conditioning technologies such
as innovative thermally activated heat pumps.
THE FUTURE OF AIR CONDITIONING
Precise and sophisticated control of air conditioning
systems will be the trend of the near future. The
explosion of innovation in computer and electronic
technology will continue to impact the design and
operation of air conditioning systems. Buildings will
become “intelligent,” their internal systems responding
to changing environmental and occupancy conditions.
“Cybernetic” building systems will
communicate information and control functions
simultaneously at multiple levels for various systems,
including heating, cooling, and ventilation energy
management, fire detection, security, transportation,
and information systems. “Interoperability” in control
systems will allow different controls to “talk to
each other” in the same language. Wireless sensors
will be used, allowing easy retrofit of older buildings.
The recent trend of integrating building design
with the environment will result in energy savings as
old concepts of natural ventilation, shading, and so
on are reapplied. Technological innovation will permit
increased use of solar technology as costs
decrease. Hybrid cooling systems using both electricity
and gas will be used in greater numbers.
The current debate over controversial global
warming theories will continue. The impact of carbon
dioxide levels in the atmosphere, whether they
are increasing or not over time, and the effect on climate
and economics will continue to be discussed. A
solution, if it is needed, may evolve—or not.
Science, technology, and public need will continue
to interact in ways that cannot be accurately predicted,
each providing a catalyst for change at various
times. However, the history of the development of
air conditioning has shown that the trend has been
beneficial. No doubt it will continue to be.
