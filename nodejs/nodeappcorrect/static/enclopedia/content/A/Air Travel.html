AIR TRAVEL
Since its inception in the 1920s, commercial air travel
has steadily grown. At first available only for the discretionary
exclusive use of the wealthy, air travel is
now an indispensable tool of business and the world
economy. Today, with the competitive marketplace
dictating routes and fares, it is now possible for almost
anyone in the developed world to fly almost anywhere.
It is critical to remember that the airline industry
is just that—a business—and the key to business
success is efficiency. No matter how romantic the
image of air travel may be, airlines exist only as long as
they are able to provide a reliable service for a reasonably
profitable price. Starting in the United States in
1978 and gradually spreading around the globe, the
economic deregulation of the airline industry has profoundly
changed the face of this critical enterprise by
greatly expanding the market for air travel while
exposing it to the vicissitudes of the free market.
In 1999 an estimated 1.5 billion people from
around the world chose to fly on commercial carriers.
Within the United States alone, 530 million passengers
chose to fly. During that year airliners took off
and landed 7.3 million times on domestic flights
alone. These aircraft consumed over 13 billion gallons
of jet fuel. According to the Air Transport
Association the U.S. airline industry spent more than
$10 billion for fuel for its members’ domestic and
international flights.
ORIGINS
With more than $100 billion in assets in U.S. carriers
alone, the airlines have constantly sought ways to
improve their ability to make money. They have
searched continuously for better, more efficient aircraft
in the endless search for greater yield and productivity.
In Europe the airline industry was
nationalized for most of its history. Consequently, the
emphasis was more on service and less on profits. In
the United States the experience was different.
Although the early commercial airlines were completely
dependent on government subsidies administered
as air mail contracts, federal policy encouraged
the airlines to develop passenger and freight service to
offset the subsidies. In the early 1930s the airlines were
given bonuses for carrying passengers and for developing
faster and safer aircraft. The government’s successful
plan was to wean the airlines off the subsidies
gradually by encouraging the development of larger,
faster, and more efficient aircraft. The immediate
result of this far-sighted policy was the creation of the
Boeing 247, the world’s first modern airliner, and the
subsequent Douglas series of commercial aircraft. In
fact, according to former American Airlines president
C. R. Smith, the 21-passenger Douglas DC-3 was the
first aircraft capable of making a profit just by carrying
passengers. By 1952 the air mail subsidy was withdrawn,
as it was no longer needed.
THE JET AGE
During the 1940s and 1950s, the airline industry
developed a new generation of large four-engine
aircraft that expanded air travel around the globe.
Douglas DC-4s, 6s, and 7s, along the Boeing
Stratoliners and the graceful Lockheed Constellations,
became the industry standard for speed, comfort, and
profitability. While these piston-engine aircraft dominated
the world’s air routes, a new generation of much
faster aircraft powered by jet engines was poised to
revolutionize air travel. First developed by de
Havilland in Great Britain, the sleek Comet entered
service in 1952 but experienced serious technical
problems that were not overcome until a new series of
aircraft built in the United States seized the market.
The Boeing 707 and the Douglas DC-8 entered service
in the late 1950s and found immediate success
throughout the world. These aircraft offered high
subsonic speeds significantly faster than their pistoneoe
engine counterparts and much larger passenger-carrying
capability. The combination of the greater reliability
of the jet and the use of much cheaper
kerosene-based fuel instead of expensive high-octane
gasoline greatly increased efficiency and productivity.
By the end of the 1960s jets had virtually replaced all
piston-engine airliners on most of the world’s air
routes. Newer, more powerful and more efficient turbofan
engines replaced the first generation of thirsty
and polluting turbojet engines. In 1970 the arrival of
the Boeing 747 dramatically increased aircraft productivity
by greatly decreasing seat-mile costs. Equipped
with four new-generation high-bypass turbofans that
were much quieter, more powerful, and more efficient,
the 747 and the wave of wide-bodied aircraft that
followed carried twice the number of passengers previously
possible, with lower operating costs.
THE DEREGULATION REVOLUTION
By the late 1970s, economists and members of the
U.S. Congress realized that despite the great efficiencies
now possible because of technological advancements,
air fares were not decreasing. In a bipartisan
effort, fifty years of regulation dating back to the days
of the Post Office contract were ended with the deregulation
of the U.S. airline industry in October 1978.
While the federal government continued to regulate
safety matters, the airlines were now free to charge
whatever fares the market would allow and were now
free to enter or exit any market they wished. The
immediate result was a flood of discount fares as millions
of people, many of whom had never flown
before, took to the sky. New airlines emerged almost
overnight, while numerous local and regional carriers
sought to compete directly with the major airlines.
These were heady days for the consumer but chaos
for the airlines. Passengers could now compare prices
as the airlines drastically cut fares to attract business.
Despite a national economy in recession, ridership
increased from 254 million to 293 million between
1978 and 1979. But problems loomed. The airline
industry is capital-intensive, with high barriers to
entry, high operating costs, and thin profit margins.
Ruthless competition did not produce long-term stability
as most of the new and many of the old airlines
fell by the wayside, unable to pay for expensive aircraft
and unable to fight against dominant carriers with
experience and large cash reserves and access to credit.
No longer protected by the government, airlines were
free to succeed or fail against the invisible hand of
market forces. Many failed. Many more were consumed
during a merger mania in the 1980s that sought
to cut overhead costs by consolidating companies.
Aviation enthusiasts lamented this logical business step
as many grand old names such as Pan American,
Eastern, Braniff, Piedmont, Frontier, and others disappeared.
An oligopoly of larger, more efficient companies
survived, ironically little different from the
oligopoly of companies that dominated before 1978.
Efficiency became the watchword after deregulation.
With competition opened up to all comers, the
airlines fought hard to make money by cutting costs
and increasing productivity. Coupled with an unexpected
crisis in the supply of fuel in 1979, there was
an industrywide effort to acquire the latest, most efficient
equipment using the latest engine technology.
Following the success of the large high-bypass turbofan
engines built for the massive wide-bodied airliners,
engine manufacturers turned their attention to
building a new generation of smaller engines using
the same advanced technology. The result was a new
series of engines that produced 20,000 to 40,000
pounds of thrust while using much less fuel than earlier
engines of comparable power.
These new engines, from Pratt & Whitney, Rolls-
Royce, and the international consortium of General
Electric and Snecma, found wide acceptance on new
and old narrow-bodied airframes. Boeing produced
its 757 in 1982, while McDonnell Douglas updated
its proven DC-9 series with the improved MD-80
line. First flown in 1965, the Boeing 737 had been a
slow seller. With deregulation and the replacement of
its low-bypass engines with two GE/Snecma CFM56
power plants, the 737 quickly became a sales leader
because of its high serviceability, low operating costs,
and high productivity. It became the aircraft of choice
for a host of new entrant and expanding airlines, such
as Southwest. The 737 in its many forms is today the
most successful jet airliner in history, with well over
4,500 sold.
In Europe, the international consortium of Airbus
Industrie took notice of the postderegulation environment
in the United States and the changing environment
in Europe as well and produced its own
efficient narrow-bodied airliner, the A320, in 1988.
Incorporating the latest technology, the A320 is the
first commercial airliner equipped with a fully computerized
“glass cockpit” and digital fly-by-wire coneoe
trol system that cuts weight, enhances safety, and
maximizes efficiency. So successful is this revolutionary
aircraft that Airbus has sold more than 2,000
A320s in just over ten years.
AIR TRAVEL TODAY
The sudden rush of growing traffic because of the
resulting lower fares taxed the aviation infrastructure
to its limits. Aircraft utilization soared from six hours
per day to twelve hours a day as load factors
increased. This led immediately to much congestion
at overcrowded airports and severe air traffic problems.
Airlines sought to maximize productivity by
funneling passengers though centralized airports, the
“hub and spokes,” where traffic could be efficiently
concentrated and dispersed throughout the airlines’
route networks. While maximizing productivity for
the airlines, the hub and spokes system strained the
facilities of these airports during peak hours of very
high traffic often causing serious delays and inconveniencing
passengers. The sheer volume of aircraft all
trying to converge on the same airport at the same
time often overwhelmed the air traffic control system.
The installation of flow control whereby the
movement of aircraft is controlled throughout the
system has alleviated some of the worst problems. By
holding aircraft at the gate of the departing airport
until the route and the gate of the receiving airport
will be clear has cut fuel consumption by preventing
the massive stacking of aircraft that used to occur at
overwhelmed airports. It has also improved the flow
of traffic around bad weather and helped to rationalize
the system. Problems with aging equipment, the
difficult introduction and integration of new technologies,
and the issues of an overworked and understaffed
labor force still hamper the effectiveness of
the nation’s air traffic control.
By the early 1990s some semblance of order had
returned to the industry. After the trying period of
consolidation in the late 1980s, a solid core of wellmanaged,
stable airlines emerged despite the cyclical
nature of the business caused by variations in the
economy and unpredictable fluctuations in the price
of fuel. A solid oligopoly of large airlines now dominates
the market and, while problems remain, much
improvement has been made. Airports are gradually
catching up to the demand for their services by spending
billions of dollars to upgrade their facilities, while
gradual improvements in air traffic control and more
rational scheduling are reducing the worst congestion
problems. In the late 1990s the airlines spent heavily
in acquiring new, efficient aircraft of all types. Boeing
and Airbus, the two largest manufacturers of airliners,
are building hundreds of aircraft each year to satisfy
the continuous demand for ever-better transports.
FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS
As the new century unfolds, Airbus and Boeing are
heavily engaged in market studies to determine the
scale and scope of the next generation of airliners. Air
travel is steadily growing domestically and internationally,
though the rate of growth is slowing.
Through 2020, the U.S. Department of Energy projects
that the growth in jet fuel consumption should
outpace that of all other liquid fuels. The Annual
Energy Outlook for 1999 foresees that by 2020 the
consumption of gasoline will drop from 65 to 61 percent,
diesel from 18 to 14 percent, while jet fuel use
will rise from 13 to 17 percent.
It is estimated that more than 80 percent of the
American population has flown at least once; if that is
true, it is effectively a fully mature market. Outside
the United States, the demand for air travel is
expanding as well, although it has been tempered by
economic downturns, particularly in the Asian market.
These factors are leading Airbus and Boeing to
the conclusion that there will exist a need for an aircraft
larger than any now flying. They differ, however,
on the question of when that aircraft will be
needed and what form it should take.
Airbus Industries is staking its plans on the
assumption that the market now exists for 1,300 aircraft
that can each seat 550 to 650 passengers. Their
marketing experts point to the heavily traveled North
Atlantic route, particularly that between New York
and London, as well as several high-density routes in
the Asia-Pacific region as evidence for this new market
and are assuming a steady 5 percent growth in
traffic. This aircraft will be needed to handle the
increased traffic expected between major population
centers and will be necessary to help overburdened
airports and air traffic control systems to handle more
people, but with a manageable number of aircraft.
The large airliner, bigger than the current 747-400
series that carries 416 and 524 passengers, will also
enjoy the lowest seat-mile costs of any aircraft, thereby
addressing the airlines’ ever-present need to
improve revenue yield.
Similarly, Boeing predicts a 4.7 percent growth in
between 2000 and 2020 but anticipates market fragmentation
instead of consolidation as airlines choose
to expand service away from the traditional population
centers and begin serving many more city pairs
not previously served. The competitive marketplace
will dictate an increased number of flights from
many more cities; therefore the demand will be for
more frequency of smaller aircraft. Boeing argues
that this is already happening over the North
Atlantic, where in 1980 the large four-engine 747
dominated travel. Today smaller, twin-aisle aircraft
such as the 767, 777, and A330, dominate as airlines
seek to bypass congested hubs. Boeing believes that
governments will keep pace with the rise in traffic by
building new airports, improving existing facilities,
and investing in improved air traffic control.
Boeing does concede that the market for a very
large aircraft will exist, particularly along the Pacific
Rim, but that that will not occur until the second
decade of the twenty-first century, ten years after
Airbus’s forecast. Boeing believes that there will be a
market for 1,030 large aircraft between 2000 and
2020. Of this number, only 425 will be for aircraft
with more than 500 seats, one-third that of Airbus’s
prediction. Boeing argues that in the future, market
fragmentation will occur in the United States as well
because of increased competition and the availability
of existing long-range, large-capacity airliners such as
the 777, which can seat up to 394 passengers.
Only time and the marketplace will determine
which manufacturer is correct. One thing that both
manufacturers agree on is that the airlines will always
demand more efficient aircraft in their constant
struggle to maintain profitability. The competition
between the two manufacturers will help ensure that
the best products will be available to the customer
and the passengers.
