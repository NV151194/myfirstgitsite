ANIMAL AND
HUMAN ENERGY
Culture is the primary mechanism of human behavior
and adaptation. Cultures are passed on socially
from generation to generation. Tools and the ways
they are made and used both shape and are shaped by
the social organizations of which they are a part. In his
classic study, The Science of Culture, Leslie A. White
suggested that cultures grow in relation to the degree
of efficiency of their tools in liberating energy from
their natural environments. A working hypothesis in
present day anthropology suggests that, in general, as
tools became more efficient and numerous, populations
increased in size and density, and new forms of
social organization had to develop to cope with these
population changes. It would be useful to consider
three very general evolutionary stages in the development
of our topic: hunting-gathering societies, early
agricultural societies, and state agricultural societies.
HUNTING-GATHERING SOCIETIES
There is archaeological evidence that the earliest
stone tools were used in Africa more than two million
years ago. These “pebble tools” were often
made from flat, ovoid river stones that fit in the
palm of one’s hand. Another stone was used to chip
off a few adjacent flakes to form a crude edge.
However crude the edge, it could cut through the
thick hide of a hunted or scavenged mammal when
fingernails and teeth could not, and thus provide the
group with several dozen to several hundred pounds
of meat—a caloric and protein windfall. It is a common
misconception that stone tools are crude and
dull. Human ancestors learned to chip tools from
silicon-based stones such as flint and obsidian that
have a glass-like fracture. Tools made from such
stones are harder and sharper than finely-honed
knives of tool steel. As early as 500,000 years ago,
well-made hand axes were being used in Africa,
Europe and Asia. There is evidence that people were
using fire as early as one million years ago. With the
advent of the use of fire, it is believed that the
amount of energy used by early man doubled from
2,000 kilocalories per person per day (energy from
food) to about 4,000 kilocalories per person per day
(Figure 1). Thus, fire and eventually the apparatus
employed to make it were important energy liberating
tools. Cooking food allowed humans to expand
their diet. Controlled fire could also be used to scare
game into the open to be hunted. Present-day
hunters and gatherers burn berry patches in a controlled
way, to encourage new plants and more
berries. Fire also subsidized body heat, allowing
people to colonize colder regions.
The Neanderthal people who lived from about
130,000 to 35,000 years ago invented gracile and efficient
“blade tools” that allowed them to make lighter
and sharper spearheads. The Upper Paleolithic
hunters who succeeded the Neanderthals made
many smaller, lighter, and super-efficient blade tools
called burins, each of which could be used for a special
purpose. These burins could be transported easily
from campsite, thus saving energy. Upper
Paleolithic hunters also made many small and efficient
tools from bone, ivory, shell and wood. The
Upper Paleolithic invention of the atlatl or “throwing
stick” allowed hunters to throw spears and darts at
animals over longer distances and with greater force
and accuracy than comparable missiles thrown by
hand.
Just at the end of the Upper Paleolithic a
Mesolithic cultural period emerged and with it several
new innovations made hunting even more energy
efficient. The bow could launch very lightweight
arrows at game, and poison for arrows decreased the
time spent stalking wounded prey. Finally, the
domestication of the dog, itself a master hunter,
lightened the hunter’s task.
Anthropological research with modern huntergatherers
suggests an ideal type or model for this kind
of society. They were nomadic and exhibited low
population size and density—on the order of thirty
people per thousand square miles. Paramount in
maintaining this low size and density was an imperative
common to all hunter-gatherer women. A
nomad woman had to move herself, all that her family
owned (which was very little), and her children at
a moments notice. Modern hunters and gatherers
often have to walk twenty miles a day, so mothers
cannot carry more than one small child. Faced with
this restriction, women are careful to space their children
so that the two or rarely three children they have
will not burden them when they must move. There
is every reason to believe that this pattern also existed
in remote times.
There was little social differentiation. No one was
particularly rich or poor. Leadership was informal
and transitory and based on cooperation and sharing,
especially with regard to meat. Although homicide
was known, intragroup conflict was usually resolved
by breaking the group into two or more subgroups
that avoided each other until the conflict was
resolved or forgotten.
Warfare was not a major cultural focus of huntergatherer
communities and most anthropologists are
of the opinion that when it did occur it was due to
population pressure exerted by agricultural and/or
state societies. Although hunter-gatherer social structure
was informal and free-form, it was efficient with
regard to hunting big animals. Studies of modern
hunter-gatherer societies indicate that very little
work is done in many such groups. With some exceptions,
hunter-gatherers worked approximately four
hours per day per adult.
EARLY AGRICULTURAL SOCIETIES
Beginning about eleven thousand years ago in the
Middle East and somewhat later in other parts of the
world, people began to experiment with the more
sedentary subsistence patterns of growing crops and
animal husbandry, and thus the Neolithic revolution
began. Scholars cite two reasons for this change.
First, the last glacial period began to wane as did
many of the big mammals associated with it. Second,
hunter-gatherer tools and organization became so
efficient that human population numbers became
relatively large and depleted the supply of game and
wild food plants. Population expansion resulted in
competition for space and directed humans toward
the invention of more intensive modes of food production.
Early Neolithic peoples domesticated the more
productive local plants, cared for them in densely
planted plots, protected them from animals and other
plants (weeds) and harvested the results. Likewise
they tamed, bred and cared for local animals and ate
them as they deemed fit. In the cases of cattle, horses,
sheep and goats, milk and its products became staple
foods. In some places larger domestic animals
became beasts of burden. For very sound ecological
reasons, agriculture allowed even early farmers to liberate
much more caloric energy from plants than
could be liberated from hunting and gathering and,
thus, many more humans could be supported per
square mile. In ecosystems, the most numerous
organisms (measured in mass) are plants. Animals
that eat plants (herbivores) are less abundant, while
animals that hunt and eat these herbivores are least
numerous. The reason for this decrease in “biomass”
as one proceeds up the food chain lies in the fact that
there is a considerable loss of energy due to inefficiency
as animals search out, eat, digest and change
the plants they consume into heat, growth and kinetic
energy. The same can be said with regard to the
killing and utilization of herbivores by hunting carnivores.
Thus when people began cultivating plants, in
effect, they stopped being carnivores and became
herbivores and their population size and density
increased. Since agricultural peoples were sedentary,
they lived in more or less permanent settlements and
their women could and did have more children. In
early agricultural societies the amount of energy liberated
per person per day rose to about 11,000 kilocalories.
In woodland areas early farmers developed swidden
agriculture. They cut down forest plots using
new and more efficient axes that were ground and
polished from hard and dense stone. The plots were
left to dry and then were burned, allowing nutrients
to return to the soil. One to three plantings could be
grown on these plots every year. Other plots were
then prepared and cropped until the original plot had
been overgrown and the process was repeated.
Swidden cycles lasted from about thirty to one hundred
years.
In general there is a correlation between human
population size and complexity of social organization.
In the 1960s, Robert Carneiro showed that there is a
rough positive correlation between the number of
organizational traits (N) in single community societies
and their population (P), expressed by the equation .
Neolithic populations increased and there was an
organizational reaction. Society became stratified
based on access to the extra calories of agricultural surplus.
It was now possible for some people to “own”
more land and animals than other people. With sedentary
lifeways it was possible to accrue and own duplicate
things and heavy things. Coercive institutions like
war evolved to protect what one had and as the means
to get more. Although more work was done in early
agricultural societies, the people in these societies
probably had, on the whole, more leisure time than
people today. The cultural florescence of the Iroquois
Indians of New York State is a case in point. Around
1000 C.E. a Proto-Iroquoian culture became evident in
the archaeological record. This Owasco culture was
characterized primarily by swidden agriculture of
maize, beans and squash supplemented by hunting
and gathering. Over the next six hundred years village
size increased as did size of dwellings. Villages became
palisaded and cannibalism became evident, indicating
that warfare was an institution of growing importance.
When Europeans began to establish contact with the
Iroquois in the 1600s, they found a people with sufficient
leisure to engage in elaborate warfare patterns
that were connected with a rich and complex ritual
life. At first contact the Iroquois were building
advanced political and governmental institutions and
establishing larger orbits of political influence based on
the collection of tribute.
STATE AGRICULTURAL SOCIETIES
Late Neolithic times saw the evolution of a technical
innovation that fostered the growth of societies that
were monumental both in population size and organization.
This innovation was irrigation. Hence, historians
such as Karl Wittfogel speak of the “hydraulic”
theory of the state. In Old World societies like Egypt,
Mesopotamia and Northern China, farmers began to
grow crops on the flood plains of great river systems,
taking advantage of the water and nutrients that these
rivers deposited on an annual basis. Irrigation works
and the subsequent population increase they stimulated
required more irrigation and an evolving
bureaucratic organization to manage workers, works
and increasing surpluses. The animal-drawn plow
became very important at this juncture and thus there
was a dramatic rise in the calories that farmers could
wrest from their environments. A man pushing a
lever could generate about 1/20 horsepower, while an
ox pulling a load (or plow) could generate 1/2 horsepower.
This new technology could support still larger
populations than could simple agriculture. The
large-scale civilizations which evolved in all three
areas supported hundreds of people per square mile.
Similar state societies based on irrigation evolved
independently in the New World even though
Conquest States like the Aztecs and the Incas of Peru
lacked both the plow and the wheel and had no beasts
of burden except the dog and the llama.
Modern State Societies depend on irrigation farming
as well as dry field agriculture based on mechanized
energy subsidies. At first steam power
accounted for these subsidies. By 1800 Watt’s steam
engine could generate 40 horsepower. Later the
internal combustion engine replaced steam. At the
height of the Industrial Revolution (c.1850) each person
used about 70,000 kilocalories per day. Today we
have entered into a new phase of social ecology subsidized
by an ever-increasing use of fossil fuels. As a
result people in developed countries now use about
140,000 kilocalories per person per day.
