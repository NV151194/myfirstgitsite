AUDITING OF
ENERGY USE
Energy conservation has always proceeded along two
main avenues. One involves new technology—by
continually improving the efficiency of appliances or
the mileage of automobiles, the overall energy intensity
(energy use per person) of society decreases.
Both the government and private industry have spent
large sums of research-and-development dollars on
countless products that has lead to great improvements
in the energy efficiency of products. The second
major avenue is improvement of actual practice,
whether at home, in a commercial building or on the
factory floor. It is based on the assumption that
through ignorance, poor operation, insufficient
maintenance, priority conflicts or in some cases simply
sloth, that energy is used less efficiently than the
current state of technology allows.
One way of closing the gap between the current
state of operations and what would be considered
“best practice” is to formally examine energy use
through energy audit. Using the term “audit” literally,
one “counts” the energy consumed (and paid for)
and matches that to necessary energy uses and practices
that result in energy waste. Remedial actions are
then planned to minimize the energy waste and save
money. In reality, a one-for-one accounting of energy
in versus energy out is rarely done. The term audit
is often avoided because of negative connotations.
Why are these negative connotations? Other terms
used include “energy survey,” “energy assessment,”
or “energy use analysis.” All do essentially the same
thing, namely examine how energy is consumed and
try to identify areas where energy and money can be
saved.
HOW THEY WORK
Energy audits are classified according to the client
served, falling generally under the categories of residential,
industrial, and commercial. Commercial
audits include public and semipublic buildings like
schools and hospitals and are sometimes referred to
as institutional audits.
Audits are done by a variety of groups and agencies,
again depending on the type of audit. Most utilities
have residential auditing programs. State and
community agencies run a number of auditing programs
for institutions and low-income housing. The
people actually doing the work are either employees
of the funding organizations (from nonprofits and
universities), or work at “for profit” energy service
companies (ESCOs), which either do contract work
for the funding sources or work directly for the
client.
The scope of the audit also varies considerably. It
can consist of anything from a brief walkthrough by
an auditor who notes possible areas for improvement
to a several month forty-person study at a major
manufacturing operation. Nearly any type of audit is
of some benefit. The simpler walkthrough type
audits can be automated to point where a computerprinted
report can be handed to the homeowner at
the end of the audit. (Consequently, the costs are
quite modest). In larger auditing efforts significant
engineering analysis often is required to generate
customized recommendations that quantify both the
costs and benefits of a particular project.
A common phrase, which has been attributed to
many different people, is that “you can’t control
what you can’t measure.” This is particularly true of
energy use and energy waste. One way energy audits
provide information to the client or end-user is by
making measurements that show energy waste and
allow its magnitude to be calculated. Therefore the
toolbox the auditor carries is almost as important as
the auditor him. The most important parameter to
measure is temperature. A thermocouple can easily
measure inside temperatures of the air and hot
water systems, but often more is needed. One common
tool is an infrared camera that is used to “map”
the temperatures of walls and ceilings. This allows
hot spots to be found where insulation is not functioning
properly and excessive heat is escaping.
Ceiling temperatures can reveal problems or suggest
the installation of destratification fans to mix the air.
Another important tool is a combustion analyzer.
Most furnaces need to be tuned periodically to maximize
performance. Typically furnace maintenance
people adjust a flame by “eye,” which cannot match
the accuracy of measuring the composition of the
flue gas with a combustion analyzer. Other important
tools are electric power meters (which can
measure for low power factor and line imbalance),
flow meters (for fan and pump sizing), light meters
and ultrasonic sound sensors (for picking up leaks
in gas systems). For best results, measurements
should be made over a significant period of time. To
do this, data-loggers are available that provide inexpensive
long-term measurements. Basically, the
more sophisticated the audit, the greater the emphasis
on measurements.
For some more advance audits, total building
modeling can be done using any of several good software
packages. One area where this is very important
is in studies of ventilation. Excess ventilation wastes
energy and some audits in the past involved measuring
total infiltration into a building by putting the
building under suction. Recently many of the old
“rules of thumb” have come under scrutiny because
insufficient ventilation can result in air quality problems.
Changes in ventilation rates has led to more
reliance on modeling.
An audit should also catalog the hardware used at a
site. Older hardware can be operating well within its
expected efficiency range and still be wasteful. The
auditor needs to know about old devices and their performance
specifications, as well as what is newly available.
It is also essential that the auditor understand
why the newer device works better. Many products
that come on the market do not live up to their marketing
hype. The auditor must filter through these and
determine which are clearly indicated for their clients.
FINANCING
While some energy audits are paid for directly, most
are either subsidized or leveraged in some way.
Utilities in the United States are required to provide
assistance in energy conservation through their
demand-side management programs. Even with the
deregulation of electricity, many states are requiring
that all energy providers pay into a “public benefits”
pool, and money from this pool be used in part to
support energy auditing. Another way of leveraging
the costs of audits is through “performance contracting.”
This process normally involves an ESCO
that will provide energy audits and system upgrades
for no direct costs to the client. The client agrees to
pay some fraction of the savings from the system
improvements to the ESCO for a contract period
(normally 5-10 years). This type of contracting has
worked best when energy improvements are clearly
measurable, such as lighting upgrades. Other types
of projects normally present a larger risk and are
therefore less common.
Energy audits are also leveraged with a system
commonly called “over the fence” energy. In this
scheme, the end-user does not buy equipment, but
purchases a commodity such as steam, heat, or compressed
air from a third party. The third party owns,
leases, or operates the equipment used to provide
the energy service. It is then in the interest of that
third party to ensure that energy audits are routinely
carried out and unnecessary energy use is kept to
a minimum.
During the 1990s, system commissioning started
to become popular. Historically, builders, architects
and owners have agreed on hardware. The owners
are guaranteed that the building will be warm in the
winter and cool in the summer. Owners now often
ask for an additional guarantee—a guarantee of performance
in terms of energy costs. A commissioning
audit does not recommend improvements, but acts as
a measuring device to ensure compliance, often of
new buildings before owners take possession. In a
commissioning audit, the auditor ensures that heating
and air conditioning systems, energy management
and control systems, and other complex
systems are installed and operating properly.
TRENDS
The interest in energy audits by end-users has historically
tracked with the price of energy. An additional
motivation appeared in the 1990s with the concern
about global warming. Energy use (the majority of
which comes from the burning of fossil fuels) directly
correlates with the emission of greenhouse gases.
Saving energy now also reduces CO2 emissions and
the buildup of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.
For many who wish to be environmentally sensitive,
auditing is a proactive step. Another change impacting
energy auditing is energy deregulation.
Deregulation is leading to open competition for both
electricity and gas. For commercial and industrial
customers, electricity prices are going down, probably
decreasing interest in energy conservation.
However, advances in electrical generation technologies
are increasing the likelihood that businesses and
institutions will be generating at least part of their
own electricity needs. There have also been recent
advances in engine-driven technologies to replace the
electric motors in chillers, air compressors and
pumps. Therefore the energy systems within a building
or plant are becoming more complex. The way in
which energy is purchased is also becoming more
complicated. Consumers are being approached by
different energy providers, some of whom are packaging
technical services such as audits with their
energy. Some fuel supplies are provided with “interruptible
service” requiring backup fuels. Some energy
is provided with “time-of-use” charges and
“ratchets” that can result in twelve months of surcharges
for the ill-advised use of energy at an inopportune
time. This added complexity makes energy
auditing an essential periodic check on operations.
