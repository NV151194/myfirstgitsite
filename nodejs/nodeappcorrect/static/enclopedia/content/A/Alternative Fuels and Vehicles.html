ALTERNATIVE FUELS
AND VEHICLES
The term alternative fuels first appeared in the energy
literature in the late 1970s as a way to refer to
nonconventional fuels—fuels that are not gasoline,
diesel or aviation fuel. Alternative fuels excludes all
fuels refined from petroleum that are normally liquid
at ambient conditions, such as gasoline through
heavy fuel oil. It does include the highly volatile
fractions: liquefied petroleum gas (propane), liquefied
natural gas, and compressed natural gas. The
category also comprises all fuels made from other
fossil fuels, such as coal and oil shale, biofuels originating
from plant material, and chemically derived
fuels such as methanol and hydrogen. The nonfossil
plant-derived fuels such as ethanol and bio-diesel
(from vegetable oils), and hydrogen made from
water via solar powered electrolysis, are the only
renewable energy alternative fuels. Electric vehicles
are considered alternative-fuel vehicles since only
about 3 percent of electricity comes from burning
petroleum.
Alternative fuels should not be confused with
alternative energy, which is another term whose origins
date back to the 1970s. Alternative energy and
alternative fuel both exclude petroleum energy, yet
alternative energy goes further by excluding all fossil
fuel sources and nuclear. However, sometimes energy
sources such as hydroelectric, which accounts for
about 10 percent of U.S. electricity production, may
be considered alternative even though it has been a
major energy source for centuries.
Of all the fossil fuels, petroleum is considered the
least sustainable fuel option (most finite and fastest
rate of depletion), which is the main reason for the
development of alternative fuels. Resources of natural
gas and coal are far greater, and depletion slower,
which makes alternative fuels developed from
these sources more sustainable. The nonfossil
plant-derived fuels of ethanol and bio-diesel (from
vegetable oils) are the only renewable energy alternative
fuels and, in theory, are considered the most
sustainable. However, there is not enough agricultural
land for biofuels alone to ever become a total
replacement for petroleum at the year 2000 world
petroleum consumption rate of about 30 million
barrels a day
In the United States, the leading use of alternative
fuels is not as standalone fuels, but as additives to
petroleum-based gasoline and diesel fuel. For example,
gasoline sold in much of the United States is 10
percent ethanol or 10 percent methyl tertiary butyl
ether (MTBE).
RECENT HISTORY
The first major government investment in an alternative
fuel was for the purpose of energy security and
oil import independence. Beginning in the late
1970s, billions of dolars were spent on synthetic fuels
(converting coal and oil shale into gasoline and
diesel). When oil prices began to fall in the early
1980s, and it became apparent that the costs of producing
synthetic fuels would remain well above that
of petroleum fuels, the program was abandoned.
Interest in alternative fuels grew again in the late
1980s in response to urban air quality problems.
Early in the 1990s, environmental regulations calling
for oxygenated fuels (nonpetroleum fuels containing
oxygen blended with gasoline) to cut carbon monoxide
emissions went into effect that significantly
increased the sales of MTBE and ethanol. In 1995,
alternative fuels comprised about 3 percent of all
fuels consumed in the United States (4.4 billion gallons
versus 142 billion for gasoline and diesel).
MTBE and ethanol consumption is greatest since
these fuels are blended with gasoline as required by
environmental regulations for carbon monoxide
reduction. However, when the 1999 National
Research Council study found that there was no statistically
significant reduction in ozone and smog
based on the data available, the continued requirement
of using MTBE was questioned, especially
since MTBE leaking from storage tanks can quickly
contaminate groundwater.
MARKET BARRIERS
Alternative fuels are advocated as a way to improve
the environment, enhance energy security, and
replace dwindling petroleum reserves. Thus, the federal
government continues to generously fund
research and development for alternative fuels either
as a replacement for, or for blending with, conventional
fuel. Among the federal subsidies and regulations
to promote alternative fuel use are the Energy
Policy Act of 1992 (requiring alternative fuel vehicles
in fleets and providing tax breaks for people who
buy these vehicles), the Intermodal Surface
Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991 (providing
grants for purchasing alternative-fuel vehicles and for
building refueling stations), and the Alternative
Motor Fuels Act of 1988 (allowing automakers to sell
more large, higher-profit conventional cars with
poorer fuel economy if they also sell alternative fuel
vehicles). However, even with subsidies and favorable
regulations, alternative fuels face significant hurdles
before becoming practical replacements for
conventional fuels. Foremost is cost, followed by
safety, practicality and reliability, and finally, the
development of infrastructure (production, distribution
and retailing availability).
Cost-Competitive
Natural-gas-derived fuels are the most cost-competitive
because natural gas does not need to be
refined like gasoline and diesel fuel from petroleum
(Figure 1). Ethanol, a heavily subsidized alternative
fuel, is not as cost-competitive as natural-gas-derived
fuels. If not for the subsidies and environmental reg-
ulations requiring oxygenates, ethanol would not be
used at all. The chances of ethanol ever becoming
cost-competitive in the free market are slim since
extensive land is needed to raise high-energy-yield
plants for fuel, and the energy that must be expended
to raise, harvest and dry the plants for the fermentation
alcohol results in a low net energy yield.
When gasoline-powered automobiles are modified
to burn a fuel such as ethanol alone, they are
known as dedicated ethanol vehicles—risky investments
for buyers who have concerns about future
availability. For example, Brazil’s Proalcool program
promoted and heavily subsidized ethanol, and thus
dedicated ethanol vehicles, from 1975 to 1988. Once
the subsidies were curtailed and then eliminated
(estimates of the costs of the subsidy to the government
range from $7 to $10 billion), shortages resulted.
Many of the owners of ethanol-dedicated
vehicles either had to junk or retrofit the vehicles to
run on gasoline, and the sales of ethanol-dedicated
vehicles went from 50 percent of the market in 1988
to 4 percent by mid-1990.
Aside from the difference in fuel costs, the cost of
redesigning and equipping vehicles engines and fuel
tanks to run on alternative fuels has to be considered.
Responding to the desire to switch fuels for cost reasons,
or refueling security when the alternative fuel is
not readily available, several auto makers offer flexible
fuel vehicles that run primarily on compressed
natural gas, but also gasoline when compressed natural
gas is not available. These vehicles are sold at a
premium and have shown little success in attracting
buyers since low fuel prices ensure their return on
investment will be poor in comparison to standard
gasoline vehicles.
Practicality and Reliability
When the energy density of the alternative fuels is
considerably less than gasoline and diesel fuel, it
greatly impacts the practicality of the fuel for transportation.
Most of the alternative fuels have a much
lower energy density (Table 1). For vehicles, much
more storage space is required to accommodate
much larger fuel tanks to achieve comparable range
or, for gaseous fuels, storage tanks that can withstand
greater compression. Moreover, it will always take
longer to refuel a vehicle using a lower-energy-density
liquid fuel or a gaseous fuel.
The lower energy density of alternative fuels is even
more problematic for aircraft. Methanol has been suggested
as a jet fuel replacement. But using methanol
would seriously curtail range and payload since the
plane’s weight is a principle determinaent of how
much fuel is needed. A typical four-engine commercial
jet will carry 775,000 pounds of aviation fuel to maximize
range; to achieve the same range with methanol
would require one million more pounds of fuel.
Since most of the alternative fuel vehicles burn
cleaner, experience has found that this reliability is
equal or better than that of comparable gasoline or
diesel fuel vehicles.
Infrastructure Needs
A vast petroleum production, refining, distribution
and retailing operation exists to deliver gasoline and
diesel fuel. The major oil companies have invented
billion of dollars in the setup and delivery of liquid
fuels that can be stored in underground tanks; thus,
any alternative fuel that requires massive new investments
in infrastructure will face considerable market
resistance. Moreover, there are personal investments
in over 200 million vehicles on the road that are
designed to consume either gasoline or diesel fuel, and
a dauntingly immense and specialized infrastructure of
industry building these vehicles and small businesses
maintaining them. Since so much of the economy has
a vested interest in the internal combustion engine
burning gasoline or diesel fuel, a market transition to
alternative fuels and vehicles is likely to be gradual.
In the free market, as long as petroleum supplies
are plentiful, there is little incentive for oil companies
to transition to any of the alternative fuels, which is a
major reason that the U.S. Department of Energy
projects petroleum consumption will rise from 18.6
million barrels per day in 1997 to 22.5-26.8 million
barrels by 2020. As the crude oil reserves dwindle, the
marketplace will either transition to the electrification
the transportation system (electric and fuel cell vehicles
and electric railways), or see the development of
alternative fuels. Any short-term transition to an alternative
fuel is likely to meet environmental air quality
regulations. Beyond 2020, the transition is likely to
occur due to the depletion of oil reserves resulting in
steeply rising gasoline and diesel prices, or from
advances in technologies that make alternative fuels
and alternative transportation more attractive.
