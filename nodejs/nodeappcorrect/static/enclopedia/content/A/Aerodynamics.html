AERODYNAMICS
The next time you hear an airplane flying overhead,
look up, and pause for a moment. What you see is a
machine that is heavier than air, but which is somehow
being sustained in the air. This is due to the
airflow over the airplane. This airflow exerts a lift
force which counteracts the weight of the airplane
and sustains it in the air—a good thing. The airflow
also exerts a drag force on the airplane which retards
its motion—a bad thing. The drag must be counteracted
by the thrust of the engine in order to keep the
airplane going. The production of thrust by the
engine consumes energy. Hence, the energy efficiency
of the airplane is intimately related to aerodynamic
drag. This is just one of many examples
where the disciplines of aerodynamics and energy
interact.
DEFINITION
Aerodynamics deals with the flow of gases, particularly
air, and the interaction with objects immersed in
the flow. The interaction takes the form of an aerodynamic
force and moment exerted on the object by
the flow, as well as heat transfer to the object (aerodynamic
heating) when the flow velocities exceed
several times the speed of sound.
SOURCES OF AERODYNAMIC FORCE
Stop for a moment, and lift this book with your
hands. You are exerting a force on the book; the book
is feeling this force by virtue of your hands being in
contact with it. Similarly, a body immersed in a liquid
or a gas (a fluid) feels a force by virtue of the body
surface being in contact with the fluid. The forces
exerted by the fluid on the body surface derive from
two sources. One is the pressure exerted by the fluid
on every exposed point of the body surface. The net
force on the object due to pressure is the integrated
effect of the pressure summed over the complete
body surface. In the aerodynamic flow over a body,
the pressure exerted by the fluid is different at different
points on the body surface (i.e., there is a distribution
of variable values of pressure over the
surface). At each point, the pressure acts locally perpendicular
to the surface. The integrated effect of this
pressure distribution over the surface is a net force—
the net aerodynamic force on the body due to pressure.
The second source is that due to friction
between the body surface and the layer of fluid just
adjacent to the surface. In an aerodynamic flow over
a body, the air literally rubs over the surface, creating
a frictional shear force acting on every point of the
exposed surface. The shear stress is tangential to the
surface at each point, in contrast to the pressure,
which acts locally perpendicular to the surface. The
value of the shear stress is different at different points
on the body surface. The integrated effect of this
shear stress distribution is a net integrated force on
the body due to friction.
The pressure (p) and shear stress (τω) distributions
over an airfoil-shaped body are shown schematically
in Figure 1. The pressure and shear stress distributions
exerted on the body surface by the moving fluids
are the two hands of nature that reach out and
grab the body, exerting a net force on the body—the
aerodynamic force.
RESOLUTION OF THE
AERODYNAMIC FORCE
The net aerodynamic force exerted on a body is illustrated
in Figure 2 by the arrow labeled R. The direction
and speed of the airflow ahead of the body is
denoted by V∞, called the relative wind. The body is
inclined to V∞. by the angle of attack, α. The resultant
aerodynamic force R can be resolved into two
components; lift, L, perpendicular to V∞; and drag, D,
parallel to V∞. In Figure 2, R is shown acting through
a point one-quarter of the body length from the nose,
the quarter-chord point. Beacuse the aerodynamic
force derives from a distributed load due to the pressure
and shear stress distributions acting on the surface,
its mechanical effect can be represented by a
combination of the net force vector drawn through
any point and the resulting moment about that point.
Shown in Figure 2 is R located (arbitrarily) at the
quarter-chord point and the moment about the
quarter-chord point, Mc/4.
The aerodynamic force varies approximately as the
square of the flow velocity. This fact was established
in the seventeenth century—experimentally by Edme
Marione in France and Christiaan Huygens in
Holland, and theoretically by Issac Newton. Taking
advantage of this fact, dimensionless lift and drag
coefficients, CL and CD respectively, are defined as
L = 1⁄2ρ∞V∞
2 S CL
D = 1⁄2ρ∞V∞
2 S CD
where ρ∞, is the ambient density in the freestream, and
S is a reference area, which for airplanes is usually chosen
to be the planform area of the wings (the projected
wing area you see by looking at the wing directly
from the top or bottom), and for projectile-like bodies
is usually chosen as the maximum cross-sectional area
perpendicular to the axis ofthe body (frontal area).
At flow speeds well below the speed of sound, the
lift coefficient depends only on the shape and orientation
(angle of attack) of the body:
CL = f (shape, α)
The drag coefficient also depends on shape and α,
but in addition, because drag is partially due to friction,
and frictional effects in a flow are governed by a
powerful dimensionless quantity called Reynolds
number, then CD is also a function of the Reynolds
number, Re:
CD = f (shape, α, Re)
where Re ≅ ρ∞V∞, c/μ∞. Here, c is the reference length
of the body and μ∞ is the viscosity coefficient of the
fluid. At speeds near and above the speed of sound,
these coefficients also become functions of Mach
number, M∞ ≅ V∞/a∞, where a∞, is the speed of sound
in the freestream:
CL = f (shape, α, M∞)
CD = f (shape, α, Re, M∞)
The lift and drag characteristics of a body in a flow
are almost always given in terms of CL and CD rather
than the forces themselves, because the force coefficients
are a more fundamental index of the aerodynamic
properties.
DRAG
One of the most important aerodynamic effects on
the consumption of energy required to keep a body
moving through a fluid is the aerodynamic drag. The
drag must be overcome by the thrust of a propulsion
mechanism, which in turn is consuming energy.
Everything else being equal, the higher the drag, the
more energy is consumed. Therefore, for energy efficiency,
bodies moving through a fluid should be lowdrag
bodies. To understand how to obtain low drag,
we have to first understand the nature of drag, and
what really causes it.
The influence of friction on the generation of drag
is paramount. In most flows over bodies, only a thin
region of the flow adjacent to the surface is affected by
friction. This region is called the boundary layer
(Figure 3). Here, the thickness of the boundary layer
is shown greatly exaggerated; in reality, for ordinary
flow conditions, the boundary layer thickness, δ, on
the scale of Figure 3 would be about the thickness of
a sheet of paper. However, the secrets of drag production
are contained in this very thin region. For example,
the local shear stress at the wall, labeled in Figure
3 as τω, when integrated over the entire surface creates
the skin friction drag Df on the body. The magnitude
of τω, hence, Df, is determined by the nature of the
velocity profile through the boundary layer, (i.e., the
variation of the flow velocity as a function of distance
y normal to the surface at a given station, x, along the
surface). This velocity variation is quite severe, ranging
from zero velocity at the surface (due to friction,
the molecular layer right at the wall is at zero velocity
relative to the wall) to a high velocity at the outer edge
of the boundary layer. For most fluids encountered in
aerodynamics, the shear stress at the surface is given
by the Newtonian shear stress law:
τω = μ (dV/dy)y=0
where μ is the viscosity coefficient, a property of the
fluid itself, and (dV/dy)y=0 is the velocity gradient at
the wall. The more severe is the velocity variation in
the boundary layer, the larger is the velocity gradient

at the wall, and the greater is the shear stress at the
wall.
The above discussion has particular relevance to
drag when we note that the flow in the boundary
layer can be of two general types: laminar flow, in
which the streamlines are smooth and regular, and an
element of the fluid moves smoothly along a streamline;
and turbulent flow, in which the streamlines
break up and a fluid element moves in a random,
irregular, and tortuous fashion. The differences
between laminar and turbulent flow are dramatic,
and they have a major impact on aerodynamics. For
example, consider the velocity profiles through a
boundary layer, as sketched in Figure 4. The profiles
are different, depending on whether the flow is laminar
or turbulent. The turbulent profile is “fatter,” or
fuller, than the laminar profile. For the turbulent
profile, from the outer edge to a point near the surface,
the velocity remains reasonably close to the
freestrearn velocity; it then rapidly decreases to zero
at the surface. In contrast, the laminar velocity profile
gradually decreases to zero from the outer edge to the
surface. Now consider the velocity gradient at the
wall, (dV/dy)y=0, which is the reciprocal of the slope
of the curves shown in Figure 4 evaluated at y = 0.
It is clear that (dV/dy)y=0 for laminar flow is less
than (dV/dy)y=0 for turbulent flow. Recalling the
Newtonian shear stress law for τω leads us to the fundamental
and highly important fact that laminar
stress is less than turbulent shear stress:
τω laminar < τω turbulent
This obviously implies that the skin friction exerted
on an airplane wing or body will depend on whether
the boundary layer on the surface is laminar or turbulent,
with laminar flow yielding the smaller skin
friction drag.
It appears to be almost universal in nature that systems
with the maximum amount of disorder are
favored. For aerodynamics, this means that the vast
majority of practical viscous flows are turbulent. The
boundary layers on most practical airplanes, missiles,
and ship hulls, are turbulent, with the exception of
small regions near the leading edge. Consequently,
the skin friction on these surfaces is the higher, turbulent
value. For the aerodynamicist, who is usually
striving to reduce drag, this is unfortunate. Today,
aerodynamicists are still struggling to find ways to
preserve laminar flow over a body—the reduction in
skin friction drag and the resulting savings in energy
are well worth such efforts. These efforts can take the
form of shaping the body in such a way to encourage
laminar flow; such “laminar flow bodies” are designed
to produce long distances of decreasing pressure in
the flow direction on the surface (favorable pressure
gradients) because an initially laminar flow tends to
remain laminar in such regions. Figure 5 indicates
how this can be achieved. It shows two airfoils, the
standard airfoil has a maximum thickness near the
leading edge, whereas the laminar flow airfoil has its
maximum thickness near the middle of the airfoil.
The pressure distributions on the top surface on the
airfoils are sketched above the airfoils in Figure 5.
Note that for the standard airfoil, the minimum pressure
occurs near the leading edge, and there is a long
stretch of increasing pressure from this point to the
trailing edge. Turbulent boundary layers are encouraged
by such increasing pressure distributions. The
standard airfoil is generally bathed in long regions of
turbulent flow, with the attendant high skin friction
drag. Note that for the laminar flow airfoil, the minimum
pressure occurs near the trailing edge, and there
is a long stretch of decreasing pressure from the leading
edge to the point of minimum pressure. Laminar
boundary layers are encouraged by such decreasing
pressure distributions. The laminar flow airfoil can be
bathed in long regions of laminar flow, thus benefiting
from the reduced skin friction drag.
The North American P-51 Mustang, designed at
the outset of World War II, was the first production
aircraft to employ a laminar flow airfoil. However,
laminar flow is a sensitive phenomenon; it readily gets
unstable and tries to change to turbulent flow. For
example, the slightest roughness of the airfoil surface
caused by such real-life effects as protruding rivets,
imperfections in machining, and bug spots can cause
a premature transition to turbulent flow in advance of
the design condition. Therefore, most laminar flow
airfoils used on production aircraft do not yield the
extensive regions of laminar flow that are obtained in
controlled laboratory tests using airfoil models with
highly polished, smooth surfaces. From this point of
view, the early laminar flow airfoils were not successful.
However, they were successful from an entirely
different point of view; namely, they were found to
have excellent high-speed properties, postponing to a
higher flight Mach number the large drag rise due to
shock waves and flow separation encountered near
Mach 1. As a result, the early laminar flow airfoils
were extensively used on jet-propelled airplanes during
the 1950s and 1960s and are still employed today
on some modem high-speed aircraft.
In reality, the boundary layer on a body always
starts out from the leading edge as laminar. Then at
some point downstream of the leading edge, the
laminar boundary layer become unstable and small
“bursts” of turbulent flow begin to grow in the flow.
Finally, over a certain region called the transition
region, the boundary layer becomes completely turbulent.
For purposes of analysis, it is convenient to
draw a picture, where transition is assumed to occur
at a point located a distance xcr, from the leading
edge. The accurate knowledge of where transition
occurs is vital to an accurate prediction of skin friction
drag. Amazingly, after almost a century of
research on turbulence and transition, these matters
are still a source of great uncertainty in drag predictions
today. Nature is still keeping some of her
secrets from us.
Skin friction drag is by no means the whole story
of aerodynamic drag. The pressure distribution integrated
over the surface of a body has a component
parallel to the flow velocity V∞, called form drag, or
more precisely pressure drag due to flow separation.
In this type of drag, such as the flow over a sphere,
the boundary layer does not totally close over the
back surface, but rather separates from the surface at
some point and then flows downstream. This creates
a wake of low-energy separated flow at the back surface.
The pressure on the back surface of the sphere
in the separated wake is smaller than it would be if
the flow were attached. This exacerbates the pressure
difference between the higher pressure on the
front surface and the lower pressure on the back surface,
increasing the pressure drag. The bigger (fatter)
the wake, the higher the form drag. Once again we
see the different effects of laminar and turbulent
flow. In the case where the boundary layer is lamieoe
nar, the boundary layer separates near the top and
bottom of the body, creating a large, fat wake, hence
high pressure drag. In contrast, where the boundary
layer is turbulent, it separates further around the
back of the sphere, creating a thinner wake, thus
lowering the pressure drag. Form drag, therefore, is
larger for laminar flow than for turbulent flow. This
is the exact opposite of the case for skin friction drag.
To reduce form drag, you want a turbulent boundary
layer.
For a blunt body, such as a sphere, almost all the
drag is form drag. Skin friction drag is only a small
percentage of the total drag. For blunt bodies a turbulent
boundary layer is desirable. Indeed, this is the
purpose of the dimples on the surface of a golf ball—
to promote turbulent flow and reduce the aerodynamic
drag on the ball in flight. The nose of an
airplane is large compared to a golf ball. Hence, on
the airplane nose, the boundary layer has already
become a turbulent boundary layer, transitioning
from laminar to turbulent in the first inch or two
from the front of the nose. Therefore, dimples are
not necessary on the nose of an airplane. In contract,
the golf ball is small—the first inch or two is already
too much, so dimples are placed on the golf ball to
obtain turbulent flow right from the beginning.
For a body that is producing lift, there is yet
another type of drag—induced drag due to lift. For
example, consider an airplane wing, that produces
lift by creating a higher pressure on the bottom surface
and a lower pressure on the top surface. At the
wing tips, this pressure difference causes the flow to
try to curl around the tips from the bottom of the tip
to the top of the tip. This curling motion, superimposed
on the main freestream velocity, produces a
vortex at each wing tip, that trails downstream of the
wing. These wing tip vortices are like minitornadoes
that reach out and alter the pressure distribution
over the wing surface so as to increase its component
in the drag direction. This increase in drag is called
induced drag; it is simply another source of pressure
drag on the body.
Finally, we note that if the body is moving at
speeds near and above the speed of sound (transonic
and supersonic speeds), shock waves will occur that
increase the pressure on the front portions of the
body, contributing an additional source of pressure
drag called wave drag.
In summary, the principal sources of drag on a
body moving through a fluid are skin friction drag,
form drag, induced drag, and wave drag. In terms of
drag coefficients, we can write:
CD = CD,f + CD,p + CD,i + CD,w
where CD is the total drag coefficient, CD,f is the skin
friction drag coefficient, CD,p is the form drag coefficient
(pressure drag due to flow separation), CD,i is
the induced drag coefficient, and CD,w is the wave
drag coefficient.
STREAMLINING
The large pressure drag associated with blunt bodies
such as the sphere, leads to the design concept of
streamlining. Consider a body of cylindrical cross
section of diameter d with the axis of the cylinder
oriented perpendicular to the flow, as shown in
Figure 6a. There will be separated flow on the back
face of the cylinder, with a relatively fat wake and
with the associated high pressure drag. The bar to
the right of the cylinder denotes the total drag on the
cylinder; the shaded portion of the bar represents
skin friction drag, and the open portion represents
the pressure drag. Note that for the case of a blunt
body, the drag is relatively large, and most of this
drag is due to pressure drag. However, look at what
happens when we wrap a long, mildly tapered afterbody
on the back of the cylinder, creating a teardropshaped
body sketched in Figure 6b. This shape is a
streamlined bod, of the same thickness d as the
cylinder. Flow separation on the streamlined body
will be delayed until much closer to the trailing edge,
with an attendant, much smaller wake. As a result,
the pressure drag of the streamlined body will be
much smaller than that for the cylinder. Indeed, as
shown by the bar to the right of Figure 6b, the total
drag of the streamlined body will be almost a factor
of 10 smaller than that of the cylinder of same thickness.
The friction drag of the streamlined body will
be larger due to its increased surface area, but the
pressure drag is so much less that it dominates this
comparison.
Streamlining has a major effect on the energy efficiency
of bodies moving through a fluid. For example,
a bicycle with its odd shaped surfaces, has a
relatively large drag coefficient. In contrast, a streamlined
outer shell used for recumbent bicycles reduces
the drag and has allowed the speed record to reach 67
mph. Streamlining is a cardinal principle in airplane
design, where drag reduction is so important.
Streamlining has a strong influence on the lift-todrag
ratio (L/D, or CL/CD) of a body. Lift-to-drag
ratio is a measure of aerodynamic efficiency. For
example, the Boeing 747 jumbo-jet has a lift-to-drag
ratio of about 20. This means it can lift 20 lb at the
cost of only 1 pound of drag—quite a leverage. In airplane
design, an increase in L/D is usually achieved
by a decrease in D rather than an increase in L.
Vehicles that have a high L/D are that way because
they are low-drag vehicles.
DRAG AND ENERGY
We now make the connection between aerodynamic
drag and energy consumption, The drag of a moving
vehicle must be overcome by the thrust from a
propulsive mechanism in order to keep the vehicle in
sustained motion. The time rate of energy consumption
is defined as power, P. The power required to
keep the vehicle moving at a given speed is the product
of drag times velocity,
P = D V∞.
Because
D = 1⁄2ρ∞V∞
2 S CD,
we have
P = 1⁄2ρ∞V∞
3 S CD.
That is, the power required varies as the cube of the
velocity, and directly as the drag coefficient. This
clearly indicates why, as new vehicles are designed to
move at higher velocities, every effort is made to
reduce CD. Otherwise, the velocity-cubed variation
may dictate an amount of energy consumption that is
prohibitive. Note that this is one of the realities facing
civil transport airplanes designed to fly at supersonic
speeds. No matter how you look at it, less drag
means more energy efficiency.
The effect of aerodynamics on the energy consumption
of transportation vehicles can be evaluated
by using the dimensionless specific energy consumption,
E, defined as E = P/WV, where P is the power
required to move at velocity V and W is the weight of
the vehicle, including its payload (baggage, passengers,
etc.). Although power required increases as the
cube of the velocity, keep in mind that the time
required to go from point A to point B is inversely
proportional to V, hence a faster vehicle operates for
less time between two points. The quantity E =
P/WV is the total energy expended per unit distance
per unit weight; the smaller the value of E, the smaller
the amount of energy required to move 1 lb a distance
of 1 ft (i.e., the more energy efficient the
vehicle). Representative values of E for different
classes of vehicles (trains, cars, airplanes) are given in
Figure 7. Using E as a figure of merit, for a given long
distance trip, trains such as the Amtrak Metroliner
and the French high-speed TGV are most efficient,
airplanes such as the Boeing 747, are next, and automobiles
are the least efficient.
DRAG OF VARIOUS VEHICLES
Let us examine the drag of various representative
vehicles. First, in regard to airplanes, the evolution of
streamlining and drag reduction is clearly seen in
Figure 8, which gives the values of drag coefficient
based on wing planform area for a number of different
aircraft, plotted versus years. We can identify
three different periods of airplanes, each with a distinctly
lowered drag coefficient: strut-and-wire
biplanes, mature propellerdriven airplanes, and
modem jet airplanes. Over the past century, we have
seen a 70 percent reduction in airplane drag coefficient.
Over the same period, a similar aerodynamic
drag reduction in automobiles has occurred. By 1999,
the drag coefficients for commercialized vehicles
have been reduced to values as low as 0.25. There are
experimental land vehicles with drag coefficients on
par with jet fighters; for example, the vehicles built
for the solar challenge races, and some developmental
electric vehicles.
The generic effect of streamlining on train engines
is similar, with the drag coefficient again based on
frontal area. The high-speed train engines of today
have drag coefficients as low as 0.2.
For motorcycles and bicycles, the drag coefficient is
not easy to define because the proper reference area is
ambiguous. Hence, the drag is quoted in terms of the
“drag area” given by D/q, where q is the dynamic pressure;
q = 1⁄2ρ∞V∞
2. A typical drag area for a motorcycle
and rider can be reduced by more than fifty percent by
wrapping the motorcycle in a streamlined shell.
SUMMARY
Aerodynamics is one of the applied sciences that plays
a role in the overall consideration of energy. We have
explained some of the more important physical
aspects of aerodynamics, and illustrated how aerodynamics
has an impact on energy efficiency.
