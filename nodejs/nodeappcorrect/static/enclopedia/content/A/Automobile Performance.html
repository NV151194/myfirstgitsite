AUTOMOBILE
PERFORMANCE
At the beginning of the twentieth century, the automobile
was still a novelty. In the United States more
cars were then powered by steam engines and battery-
electric systems than by internal-combustion
engines. By the end of the twentieth century, the
automobile had become an integral part of the
American lifestyle, with approximately one privately
owned passenger vehicle in operation for every two
people. Practically all of these vehicles were powered
by internal-combustion engines burning a fuel
derived from petroleum.
New cars are purchased on the basis of such qualities
as performance, fuel economy, reliability, durability,
ride quality, noise and vibration, comfort,
convenience, maintenance requirements, styling,
safety, environmental qualities, price, and resale value.
Many of these attributes conflict. The conflict
between performance and fuel economy serves as an
example. The typical driver wants a vehicle with sufficient
power to merge safely into high-speed freeway
traffic, or to pass a slowly moving highway truck on an
upgrade. To maintain performance when the vehicle
is carrying a heavy load, or pulling a trailer, or operating
at high altitude can call for even more installed
engine power. That desire for performance potential
persists with the typical consumer even though it is
used only very occasionally in normal driving.
Installing a more powerful engine to meet performance
expectations typically penalizes average fuel
economy. To accommodate a range of expectations,
manufacturers frequently offer a given car model
with a choice of more than one engine. In a recent
example, one car model is offered with its base
engine and two engine options that exceed the base
engine in rated power by 13 percent and 26 percent
respectively. While offering greater performance,
those optional engines decrease fuel economy in typical
driving by 5 percent and 10 percent respectively.
In striking a balance between performance and fuel
economy, the typical United States consumer leans
more heavily toward performance than his overseas
counterpart because the pump price of gasoline in the
United States is only about a third of what it is in
many overseas nations. Moreover, tax policies in
some overseas countries, discourage the use of large
and powerful engines.
The petroleum from which gasoline is derived is a
depletable resource. Passenger cars and light-duty
trucks account for about 40 percent of national petroleum
consumption. In recent years, imported petroleum
has supplied an increasing proportion of U.S.
needs. This adversely affects the U.S. balance of
trade. Currently about half of the oil consumed is
imported. Nearly a quarter of U.S. fuel consumed
comes from Organization for Petroleum Exporting
Countries (OPEC), a group organized to control the
price of oil. About 10 percent of consumption is
imported from the Persian Gulf segment of OPEC,
where the potential for political instability is a national-
security issue. Gasoline combustion also accounts
for about 20 percent of the carbon dioxide generated
in the combustion of fossil fuels in the United States.
The growing concentration of carbon dioxide in the
atmosphere threatens to increase world average temperature.
For reasons such as these, the federal government
has established minimum fuel-economy
standards for light-duty vehicles.
Several different metrics are used to assess vehicle
performance. Included are the time required to travel
a specified distance from a standing start, the time
required to accelerate from rest or from some initial
speed to a specified final speed, and the speed that can
be maintained on a specified upgrade without downshifting
the transmission from its highest gear. In the
United States, the most frequently used metric of
this nature is the time required to reach 60 mph from
a standing start.
This is not to imply that a full-throttle acceleration
from rest to that speed is a maneuver frequently
executed by the typical driver. The time to 60
mph is rather an easily measured parameter that
serves as a surrogate for other performance metrics.
A car that is slow from 0 to 60 mph will likely have
slow response from 40 to 60 mph for freeway merging,
or prove lethargic when climbing hills.
Reflecting the market preference of the typical newcar
buyer, for the average new U.S. passenger car,
the acceleration time from 0 to 60 mph has
decreased from about 14 seconds in 1975 to fewer
than 11 seconds in 1995.
This gain has not come entirely at the expense of
fuel economy, however. Over that same twenty-year
span, the fuel economy of the average new U.S. car
increased by 80 percent. These advances are attributable
to lower vehicle weight, improved tires, reduced
aerodynamic drag, improved transmissions, and gains
in engine efficiency.
ACCELERATION PERFORMANCE
When a driver commands an increase in vehicle
velocity, that vehicle obeys Newton’s first law of
motion, which states that when a force (F) acts on a
body of mass (M) and initially at rest, that body will
experience an acceleration (a). For an automobile,
typical units for acceleration, which is the rate of
change of velocity, would be miles per hour per seceoe
ond. Mass is further defined as the weight of the
body (W) divided by the acceleration of gravity (g).
The product of force F and the rolling radius (R) of
the tires on the drive wheels is the wheel torque (T).
Power depends on both torque and rotational speed
(N). By definition, power is given by P = 2πNFR =
2πNT. When driving at constant speed, the driver
adjusts the accelerator pedal so the drive-wheel power
exactly matches the power required (Pr) to overcome
the resistance of the vehicle (discussed later in this
article). To accelerate the vehicle, the driver further
depresses the accelerator pedal so that the power available
at the drive wheels (Pa) exceeds Pr.
When applying Newton’s law to a moving automobile,
acceleration depends on the excess of power over
that required for constant-speed driving, namely Pa –
Pr. From this it follows that the instantaneous acceleration
(a) of the vehicle at a given road speed (V) is
a = g (Pa – Pr) / WV (1)
For maximum vehicle acceleration, the driver
depresses the accelerator pedal to the floorboard and
the engine operates with a wide-open throttle. The
power required curve traces the power needed by the
car as a function of vehicle velocity when it is operated
at constant speed in still air on a level road. At any
given speed, the difference between these curves,
Pa–Pr in Equation 1, is available for accelerating and
hill climbing.
In the above expression for vehicle acceleration,
the proper weight to use is the effective vehicle
weight, which is the actual weight plus an additional
increment that accounts for the rotating inertia of the
engine, drivetrain, and wheels. For a passenger car
driven in high gear, the ratio used for normal driving,
this increment amounts to about 10 percent of the
vehicle weight. It is substantially higher in the lower
gears, however, because at a given road speed, the
rotational speed of the engine and part of the transmission
is multiplied by the transmission gear ratio.
This increase in rotational speed magnifies their
influence on the effective weight of the vehicle. For
illustrative purposes, however, this adjustment to
vehicle weight for rotational inertia is ignored here.
POWER REQUIRED
The force required to move the vehicle forward is the
sum of four components: rolling resistance, aerodynamic
drag, acceleration force, and grade requirement.
This required force is converted into power
required by multiplying by the forward velocity of
the vehicle with respect to the road.
Rolling resistance stems from the energy expended
in deforming the tire and the surface of the road at the
contact patch between tire and roadbed. The power
required to overcome rolling resistance (Pr) depends
on the rolling resistance coefficient (Cr), and the vehicle
weight (W) and velocity (Vv). It is given by
Pr = Cr W Vv (2)
Cr tends to increase slightly with speed but is often
considered constant over the normal speed range of
an automobile.
The rolling resistance coefficient of a tire depends
on the construction of the tire carcass, the elastic
characteristics of the tire material, the tread design,
and characteristics of the roadbed. It increases with
decreasing wheel diameter, tire underinflation, and
roadbed compliance. It decreases as the operating
temperature of the tire rises.
Before the 1960s, the bias-ply tire exemplified
standard construction. It had a typical rolling resistance
coefficient of 0.015 on hard pavement. Since
then, the radial-ply tire has emerged, offering a coefficient
closer to 0.010. Coefficients as low as 0.008 to
0.009 have been claimed in tires suitable for use on
passenger cars. Cutting the coefficient from 0.015 to
0.008 offers the opportunity for about a 10 percent
reduction in fuel consumption.
Other qualities sought in a tire include ride quality,
cornering ability, traction characteristics on both
dry and slippery roads, tire noise, life, and cost.
Addressing these qualities often opposes the objective
of lower rolling resistance.
The force of aerodynamic drag opposing forward
motion of the vehicle depends on its drag coefficient
(Cd), its frontal area (Af), the air density (ρ), and the
velocity of the wind with respect to the vehicle. In
still air, this velocity is simply the vehicle velocity
(Vv). If driving into a headwind of velocity Vw, however,
the wind velocity with respect to the vehicle is
the sum of these two. Multiplying the aerodynamic
drag force by vehicle velocity provides the aerodynamic
power requirement (Pa).
Pa = 1⁄2 ρAf Vv (Vv + Vw)2 (3)
The drag coefficient for an automobile body is typically
estimated from wind-tunnel tests. In the wind
tunnel, the drag force acting on a stationary model of
the vehicle, or the vehicle itself, is measured as a
stream of air is blown over it at the simulated vehicle
speed. Drag coefficient depends primarily on the
shape of the body, but in an actual vehicle is also
influenced by other factors not always simulated in a
test model.
For example, the windage loss associated with the
rotating wheels increases drag. Covering the wheel
wells can reduce this adverse effect. Although suitable
for rear wheels, a body-mounted cover over the
front wheel wells interferes with steering because
during sharp turns, the front wheels extend beyond
the plan-view profile of the car body.
A smooth underbody also would improve fuel
economy by reducing drag but is rarely used because
of more pressing demands. For example, a continuous
smooth underbody interferes with engine-compartment
ventilation, blocking the normal exit route
for engine cooling airflow that has passed through
the radiator. It also interferes with accessibility for
routine engine servicing. Farther to the rear, it is
desirable to expose the exterior surfaces of the hot
running exhaust system, which includes a catalytic
converter and muffler, to the flowing airstream for
cooling. Therefore, covering them with an underbody
panel creates problems.
Another source of increased drag involves the
external-surface details. In this regard, stand-alone
bumpers, externally protruding door handles, and
running boards alongside the passenger compartment
to facilitate entry, all of which were once universal,
have disappeared. Flush rather than recessed
side windows have come into recent use. On the
other hand, external rear view mirrors, which
increase drag, have been added as a safety measure.
Over the years, the flat vertical windshield of 1920
has given way to an increasingly raked windshield,
first curved in two dimensions, but now in three.
The once ubiquitous vertical flat radiator that fronted
the engine compartment has disappeared into a
compartment covered by a streamlined front body.
Fenders and headlights, both of which were once free
standing, are now incorporated into that body.
A major fraction of the aerodynamic drag in the
modern streamlined car is caused by flow separation
at the rear of the body. Alleviating that separation
calls for a long afterbody that tapers to a point.
Depending on driving conditions, this change could
decrease fuel consumption by about 15 percent, with
even greater improvement on the highway but less in
the city. However, such a sharp tailpiece is useless for
carrying passengers, of minimal utility in storing luggage,
prohibitively dangerous for storing fuel, and
impairs vehicle handling and parking.
The equation given above for the power required
to overcome aerodynamic drag (Pa) is expressed for a
vehicle driving into a headwind. If, instead, the wind
direction is from the rear, the sign on the wind velocity
changes from positive to negative, and the aerodynamic
drag is reduced. In practice, however, the wind
almost never blows directly from either the front or
the rear. When the wind approaches from an angle
oblique to the direction of travel, the wind velocity
relative to the vehicle is the vector sum of the travel
velocity and the wind velocity. The vehicle crosssectional
area encountered by this relative wind is
greater than the frontal area Af, and the vehicle shape
was not designed for that oblique wind direction. As
a result, the drag coefficient can increase as much as
50 percent above its value when the direction of the
wind is aligned with the vehicle centerline.
The power expended in accelerating the vehicle
represents an investment in kinetic energy that is
stored in the vehicle by virtue of its motion. It can be
partially recovered during vehicle coasting, but most
of it is usually dissipated as heat in the brakes when
the vehicle is decelerated or brought to a stop. The
acceleration power (Pk) depends on vehicle weight
(W), velocity (Vv), and the rate of change of velocity
with respect to time, which is the instantaneous acceleration
(a). The power for acceleration is given by
Pk = (W a Vv) / g (4)
where g is the gravitational constant. If the car is
being powered in a decelerating mode, the sign on
this acceleration term becomes negative.
The final term in the equation for required power
is that which accounts for driving on a grade (Ph).
The severity of a grade is normally defined as the
ratio of its vertical rise (h) to its horizontal run (L),
expressed as a percentage. On U.S. interstate highways,
the grade is usually limited to 4 percent (h/L =
0.04). On public roads, grades as high as 12 percent
may be encountered. For grades no steeper than that,
Ph is closely approximated by
Ph = W Vv (h/L) (5)
If the vehicle is on a downgrade rather than an
upgrade, the sign on this term becomes negative.
POWER AVAILABLE
The full-throttle capability of a typical gasoline
engine, as delivered to the wheels by the drivetrain,
was shown as a function of car speed for four transmission
gear-ratios. In any given gear, engine fullthrottle
power rises with increasing engine speed,
leveling off at maximum power and then falling again
as engine speed is further increased. This characteristic
is dominated by the influence of engine speed on
mass airflow rate and on engine friction.
Mass airflow rate is the principal determinant of
the maximum power that can be developed within
the engine cylinders. As speed increases, the cylinders
ingest more air. Therefore, one might expect the
power developed in the cylinders to increase in proportion
to engine speed. However, the aerodynamic
losses in the air passing through the cylinders rise at
an increasing rate as engine speed is increased. This
causes the mass airflow rate, and with it the power
developed in the cylinders, to reach a maximum at
some high engine speed that typically lies beyond the
normal operating range of the engine.
The power delivered by the engine crankshaft is
less than that developed within the engine cylinders
by the power expended in overcoming engine friction.
Friction power also increases with speed at an
increasing rate. As a consequence, the power output
delivered at the engine crankshaft peaks at some
speed less than that at which the cylinders achieve
their maximum power.
The power developed on the crankshaft is further
depreciated by the requirements of such accessories
as the electric alternator, power steering pump, and
air conditioner. The drivetrain that connects the
crankshaft output to the vehicle drive wheels causes a
further loss in power. Drivetrain efficiency generally
falls within 80 to 95 percent. The remaining useful
propulsive power varies with speed.
Design features in the engine and transmission can
effect seemingly subtle changes to the shape of the
power available curve that are important to vehicle
drivability. Automotive engineers normally address
this issue in terms of available torque, rather than
power, as a function of speed. Torque, of course, is
determined by dividing power by rotational speed. An
objective is to produce high torque at low speeds in
order to minimize the need for transmission shifting.
Before the 1980s, engine air was normally inducted
through an air cleaner mounted directly on the
carburetor. Replacing the carburetor with electronically
controlled fuel injection just ahead of the intake
valves has minimized large areas of intake-manifold
walls wetted with liquid fuel, which impaired engine
response to quick depression of the accelerator pedal.
This virtual elimination of wetted walls in the air
intake system has facilitated use of a carefully
designed intake system that includes a plenum and
long air pipes. The components of this system are
carefully proportioned to enhance torque at low
engine speeds.
Another method of advantageously reshaping the
torque variation with engine speed is the incorporation
of variable valve actuation. This includes the
options of variable valve timing; variable valve lift;
and in engines with two intake valves per cylinder,
the deactivation of one of them at low engine speeds.
Variable valve actuation may be used not only to
enhance low-speed torque but also to improve other
operating aspects of the engine.
In automatic transmissions, a torque converter has
long been incorporated to increase delivered torque
at low vehicle speeds, as during acceleration from a
standing start. In the torque converter, the engine
shaft is fastened to a centrifugal pump that converts
the torque delivered by the engine into flow energy
in a hydraulic fluid. An adjacent hydraulic turbine
converts this flow energy back into shaft torque for
delivery to the input side of the transmission gearbox.
Because there is no mechanical connection between
pump and turbine, turbine speed is independent of
pump speed and allows the vehicle wheels to be stationary
while the pump rotates at engine speed.
Through the action of a row of stationary vanes located
between the pump inlet and the turbine discharge,
the torque converter is able to multiply engine output
torque at the expense of gearbox input speed. This
ability of the torque converter to multiply torque typically
allows the gearbox of the automatic transmission
to meet the needs of the vehicle with one less
gear step than would be needed in an equivalent
manual transmission.
When the vehicle is at a standstill, the torque converter
delivers approximately twice the engine torque
to the gearbox. This torque multiplication falls
toward unity as the vehicle accelerates from rest and
as the turbine speed catches up with the pump speed.
At the coupling point, turbine speed nearly equals
pump speed; torque multiplication ceases; and the
stator is unlocked, allowing it to spin freely. The
small speed difference, or slip, between pump and
turbine then existing causes a minor loss in transmitted
power. The 1970s witnessed increasing use of a
torque-converter clutch that reduces this slip loss by
joining the pump to the converter when the coupling
point has been reached. (Actually, a slight slip in this
clutch may be employed to minimize the transmission
of engine vibrations to the driver.)
Because of the importance of mass airflow rate in
establishing engine output power, power available is
sensitive to ambient conditions. Full-throttle engine
power varies approximately inversely with inlet-air
absolute temperature, but more significantly, approximately
directly with ambient pressure. Mountain
passes exist on public roads in the United States that
have altitudes of over 12,000 ft. The normal atmospheric
pressure at such altitudes results in a one-third
loss in power capability in the typical passenger-car
engine.
POWER RESERVE
Power available at full throttle in top gear is again
plotted against vehicle speed in Figure 1, along with
power required curves for three different conditions.
Figure 1a is for driving on a level road in still air,
Figure 1b for driving on a level road into a 25 mp/h
headwind, and Figure 1c for driving up a 6 percent
grade in still air. In each case, the difference between
power available and power required that is available
for acceleration, termed the power reserve, is shown
shaded. Clearly, the power reserve in top gear is
diminished significantly by driving into a headwind
or by hill climbing.
Vehicle maximum speed is indicated in Figure 1
by the intersections of the power available and power
required curves. It is seen to fall from more than 120
mph to 90 mph in going from conditions of Figure 1a
to Figure 1c. In the early days of the automobile, top
speed was of greater importance than today. The
Panhard Levassor of 1886 was capable of only 12
mph. In about 1900, cars with a top speed of about 40
mph had become available, which may have been
adequate for existing roads. When the first concrete
road appeared in 1909, the Olds Limited could reach
65 mph. With its 108 horsepower engine, the 1935
Cadillac attained 85 mph. An additional 25 hp
enabled the 1951 Cadillac to top 98 mph.
That a modern automobile may be able to exceed
100 mph is of no direct consequence in U.S. driving
because these speeds are illegally high in nearly all
locations. What accompanies the deterioration in top
speed illustrated in Figure 1, however, is the obvious
loss in power reserve at more commonly driven
speeds. This reserve is so small—for example at 40
mph on a 6 percent grade—that in real driving, frequent
gear shifting between fourth and third gear
could be rendered necessary by minor disturbances
such as wind gusts or on-off cycling of the air conditioner.
Such shifting requirements, whether imposed
on the driver by a manual transmission or done for
the driver in an automatic transmission, are sources
of driver dissatisfaction. In addition, fuel economy is
poorer in the downshifted gear because the engine is
forced to operate at a higher speed with lower thermal
efficiency.
A corresponding situation occurs at high altitude,
where one-third of the sea-level power available has
been lost due to low atmospheric pressure. This low
air density also reduces aerodynamic drag, but rolling
resistance is unaffected by altitude. As a result, power
reserve is seen to suffer. In fact, at this altitude, the
power available in fourth gear is insufficient to operate
the vehicle on a 6 percent grade at any speed without
downshifting.
Past studies of passenger-car performance have
shown that the acceleration time from 0 to 60 mph
correlates well with vehicle weight/power ratio.
Although a small difference was found between automatic
and manual transmissions, most measured data
falls within the band shown in Figure 2, where test
weight corresponds to vehicle curb weight plus two
150-lb passengers or their weight equivalent. This
suggests that performance can be improved either by
increasing installed engine power, which tends to
depreciate fuel economy, or by decreasing vehicle
weight, which tends to improve fuel economy.
FUEL ECONOMY
Vehicle fuel economy is normally measured in miles
per gallon. At any given instant, it depends on the
energy content of a gallon of fuel (Qf), the vehicle
velocity (Vv) and power required (Preq), the thermal
efficiency with which the engine converts fuel energy
into useful output work (ηe), and the mechanical
efficiency with which the driveline delivers that work
to the vehicle wheels (ηd). Specifically,
Miles/Gallon = Qf Vv ηe ηd / Preq (6)
On a transient driving schedule, this instantaneous fuel
economy must be averaged over the distance driven.
In earlier times it was customary to eliminate vehicle
velocity as a variable by measuring fuel economy while
driving at a constant speed, typically 40 mph. Fuel
economy at this speed generally falls within 10 percent
of its maximum level-road value. Fuel economy falls
off at both much lower and much higher speeds.
The shortcoming of a constant-speed test is that
in traffic, nobody drives at constant speed.
Consequently, with the onset of the federal fueleconomy
standards that took effect in the United
States in 1978, the Environmental Protection Agency
(EPA) prescribed transient driving schedules deemed
representative of both urban and highway driving.
The EPA urban driving schedule is diagramed in
Figure 3a. Its 18 start-and-stop cycles cover 7.5 miles
in 1,372 seconds, with an average speed of 19.5 mph
and a peak speed of 56.7 mph. The Federal Test
Procedure (FTP) used for measuring exhaust emissions
is based on this schedule. It involves operating
a car, which has been initially stabilized at room temperature,
for the prescribed 7.5 miles, shutting off the
engine for 10 minutes, then restarting and repeating
the first five cycles. The FTP is performed on a chassis
dynamometer, with the vehicle stationary and the
drive wheels turning a roller in the floor that is connected
to an electric generator. That generator is
loaded to simulate the rolling resistance and aerodynamic
drag that would be encountered when actually
driving the vehicle on the road. The urban fuel
economy (MPGu) is determined from this test.
The schedule used to measure highway fuel economy
(MPGh), also driven on a chassis dynamometer, is
diagramed in Figure 3b. It covers 10.2 miles in 765 seconds
at an average speed of 48.2 mph and a peak speed
of 59.9 mph. In contrast to the urban schedule, there
are no stops and starts during the highway schedule.
For regulatory purposes the fuel economy
assigned to the vehicle from these tests is based on
the premise that the vehicle will accumulate 55 percent
of its mileage on the urban schedule and 45 per-
cent on the highway. The resulting composite fuel
economy (MPGc) is thus calculated according to:
1/MPGc = 1/(0.55/MPGu + 0.45/MPGh) (7)
For a typical passenger car of the 1990s, the effect on
fuel consumed over the urban and highway schedules,
and also on composite fuel consumption, is
illustrated in Figure 4 for independent 10 percent
changes in vehicle weight, aerodynamic drag, and
rolling resistance coefficient. On the urban schedule,
vehicle weight has the greatest significance because of
the dominant effect of acceleration power associated
with the many start-and-stop cycles. This power,
invested in kinetic energy during accelerations, is not
recouped because the brakes are applied during the
succeeding decelerations. On the highway schedule,
which lacks frequent starts and stops, the high average
speed makes aerodynamic drag the dominant factor.
This reflects the exponential dependence of drag
on speed.
At the bottom of Figure 4, the effect of fuel consumed
during unpowered engine operation, which
occurs during closed-throttle decelerations and
engine idling at zero vehicle speed, also is shown.
The fuel expended during unpowered operation is
greatest on the urban schedule because of the time
spent braking and standing during that schedule.
It is clear from Figure 4 that weight is the vehicle
parameter of greatest significance to composite fuel
economy. The power increments required to overcome
rolling resistance, provide acceleration performance,
and climb hills all vary directly with vehicle
weight. The power required to overcome aerodynamic
drag relates indirectly because vehicle frontal area, a
factor in determining interior roominess, tends to
correlate with vehicle weight. The importance of
weight to performance was established in Figure 2.
Over the years, consumer desire for more interior
roominess and greater luggage capacity has combined
with mandated weight-increasing safety and emissions
devices to complicate weight reduction.
Despite this, the curb weight of the average new U.S.
passenger car decreased 21 percent from 1975 to
1995, in which year it was 2,970 lb. Over those same
years, however, the curb weight of the average lightduty
truck increased 4 percent, to 3,920 lb in 1995.
During those two decades, the category of light-duty
trucks has been swollen by the popularity of lightduty
vans and sports-utility vehicles included in this
category. The sales ratio of these light-duty trucks to
the lighter passenger cars climbed from about 20 percent
in 1975 to near 40 percent in 1995. This increase
in the proportion of truck sales meant less reduction
in the weight of the fleet-average vehicle than might
otherwise be expected.
Much of the passenger-car weight reduction has
resulted from basic design changes, but some came
from materials substitution. From 1978 to 1997, the
portion of domestic-car weight attributable to ferrous
materials has dropped from 74 to 67 percent.
Concurrently, lighter aluminum climbed from 3.2 to
6.3 percent of car weight, and plastics and composites
from 5.0 to 7.5 percent. Magnesium, which is lighter
than aluminum, is finding limited application.
Research is intense on composites, which combine
glass or carbon fibers with a plastic binding material.
Such composites are light, strong, and can be formed
into complex shapes, but their high cost and long
manufacturing cycle times have impeded their
acceptance in high-production automobiles.
HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE
U.S. automotive history reveals a fairly continuous
improvement in both performance and fuel economy,
but the relative interest in each is influenced by
externalities. When gasoline is plentiful and inexpensive,
the consumer is more interested in performance
and/or larger vehicles, both of which tend to decrease
fuel economy. During the Arab oil shocks of the
1970s, when the gasoline supply was stifled and driv-
ers sometimes waited in line to fill their tanks, fuel
economy became more important. Likewise, fuel
economy received special emphasis from 1975 to
1980 as manufacturers scrambled to meet the newly
imposed and rapidly rising fuel-economy standards.
In earlier days, performance was often measured
in terms of acceleration time to 60 mph from an initial
speed of 10 mph rather than from a standstill.
Fuel economy at a steady 40 mh is plotted against that
acceleration time in Figure 5. The acceleration scale
is reversed so that the best-performing cars are on the
right. The data are averaged over a fleet of thirtyeight
models from eighteen U.S. manufacturers. The
two branches of the plot represent fleets from 1933 to
World War II, during which civilian car production
was suspended, and from the postwar years until
1955. Over this twenty-two year span, fuel economy
increased 25 percent and acceleration time was
improved 40 percent.
More recent data, from 1975 through 1995, are presented
in Figure 6. The EPA classifies passenger-cars
according to interior roominess. The four classes represented
in Figure 6—sub compact, compact, mid size
sedan, and large sedan—accounted for from 74 percent
of the new passenger-car fleet in 1975 to 94 percent
in 1995. The average composite fuel economy at
five-year intervals is plotted for each car class against
the corresponding average acceleration performance,
as estimated by the EPA from vehicle installed power
and test weight. In these estimates, each car is assumed
to be carrying a 300-lb load. Curves on the plot indicate
trends for each of the five years sampled.
The trend shown in a given year has been to offer
somewhat better performance in larger cars than in
smaller ones. However, the large sedan is able to
carry a heavier load than a sub compact. Loading the
large sedan more heavily, rather than with the same
300 lb as in the sub compact, would erode the apparent
performance advantage of the large car.
It is seen from Figure 6 that in any given year, a
fuel-economy spread of 6 to 8 mpg exists between
the sub compact and the large sedan. A major contributor
to this difference is the increased weight of
the larger car. The average large sedan was 60 percent
heavier than the average sub compact in 1955, with
that spread decreasing to 30 percent in 1995.
Reduced weight has been a major contributor to
the improvements in performance and fuel economy
over the twenty-year span of Figure 6. From 1975 to
1980 the test weight of the average new passenger car
fell nearly 25 percent. It has crept up slowly in the
following fifteen years, but in 1995 was still 20 percent
less than in 1975. The trend from rear-wheel to
front-wheel drive aided in reducing weight. In 1975,
front-wheel drive appeared in fewer than 10 percent
of the new-car fleet, but its fleet penetration rose to
80 percent in 1995.
Although the average passenger-car engine produced
about 10 percent more maximum power in
1995 than in 1975, it did so with approximately 40
percent less piston displacement as a result of
advances in engine technology. The average 1995
engine also was lightened through greater use of non
ferrous materials in its construction.
Typical passenger-car fuel economy was boosted
slightly around 1980 with the entry of the light-duty
diesel. A 25 percent increase in miles per gallon was
claimed for that engine, about half of which resulted
from the higher energy content of a gallon of diesel
fuel relative to gasoline. Diesel-engine penetration of
the new-passenger-car fleet peaked in 1981 at 5.9 percent,
and a year later in the light-duty truck fleet at 9.3
percent. By 1985 the popularity of the diesel had
waned, with penetration of the combined fleet being
less than 1 percent as of the turn of the century.
In the drivetrain arena, the torque-converter automatic
transmission has long dominated the U.S.
passenger-car fleet, appearing in about 80 percent of
new passenger cars in both 1975 and 1995. Its penetration
in light-duty trucks has risen from 63 percent
in 1975 to nearly 80 percent in 1995. However, the
automatic transmission of 1995 was much improved
over the 1975 model. In 1975, three-speed automatics
and four-speed manual transmissions were the norm.
By 1995 the more efficient four-speed automatic with
torque-converter clutch had taken over, while manual-
transmission vehicles enjoyed enhanced fuel economy
through the addition of a fifth gear.
Looking back a century in the United States,
when draft horses outnumbered automobiles and
police enforced a speed limit of 10 mph on cars in
some locales, the individual improvements that have
since accrued to the automotive vehicle have transformed
it into a necessity in the lives of many
Americans. Gains in both performance and fuel
economy have contributed importantly to its popularity.
In the last quarter of the twentieth century,
during which fuel economy regulation began in the
United States, average new-car fuel economy has
increased 80 percent at the same time that performance
capability, as measured by acceleration time to
60 mph, has improved 25 percent. Both have benefited
most significantly from a reduction in the
weight of the average car, but over this time period
the summation of effects from myriad other individual
improvements has contributed even more to fuel
economy. These individual improvements can be
grouped into factors influencing engine efficiency,
the efficiency of the drivetrain connecting the engine
to the drive wheels of the vehicle, the rolling resistance
of the tires, vehicle aerodynamic drag, and the
power consumed by accessories either required for
engine operation or desired for passenger comfort
and convenience. Engine improvements can be further
classified as to whether they improve the quality
and control of the mixture inducted into the
cylinders, increase the air capacity of the engine,
improve the efficiency of the energy conversion
process associated with combustion, or reduce the
parasitic losses associated with engine friction and
the pumping of gas through the engine cylinder.
With multiple technological improvements possible
in each of these classifications, their additive effects
can become significant even though the improvement
attached to each individually is small.
Sometimes gains are realized through interaction
among separate components. For example, an
improved transmission may enable the engine to run
at a more efficient point in its operating range, even
though the engine itself experiences no change in its
overall efficiency characteristics.
