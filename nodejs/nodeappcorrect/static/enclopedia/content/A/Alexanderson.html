     	ALEXANDERSON,
ERNST FREDERIK
WERNER
(1878–1975)
Ernst F. W. Alexanderson was a Swedish American
engineer and inventor who is best remembered for
his pioneering work on the high frequency alternator
that made long-distance radio communication possible.
He was born on January 25, 1878, in Uppsala,
Sweden. His father, Aron M. Alexanderson, taught
classical languages at the University of Uppsala and
was later chair of classical languages at the University
of Lund. Alexanderson’s mother was the former
Amelie von Heidenstam. The young Alexanderson
was educated at Lund High School and then at the
University of Lund (between 1896 and 1897). He
continued his studies at the Royal Institute of
Technology in Stockholm, and later, in Berlin, he
studied under the instruction of Adolf K. H. Slaby,
the inventor of a primitive form of radio communication.
Alexanderson was anxious to put his knowledge
to practical use. America, which seemed at that time
to be the fountainhead of many important technological
advancements, beckoned. Arriving in New
York in 1901, he immediately went to work as a
draftsman for the C. & C. Electrical Company in
New Jersey. Alexanderson sought out and was
quickly befriended by the esteemed inventors
Thomas Edison and Charles Steinmetz. In 1904,
after passing General Electric’s engineering exams,
he became a member of that company’s engineering
staff.
Alexanderson’s big break came when he was commissioned
by Reginald Fessenden, a pioneering wireless
operator, to build a generator that could produce
alternating, high frequency currents. These currents
would be used to generate a continuous, dependable
wave for radio transmission and thus enable a broadcast
of more complexity. On Christmas Eve of 1906,
Alexanderson’s invention was used to broadcast the
first radio show that featured singing and conversation.
Guglielmo Marconi, the Italian engineer and
inventor, visited Alexanderson in 1915 and bought
one of his 50-foot alternators for the transatlantic
Marconi Center in New Jersey. Within a few
years, Alexanderson’s alternators were to be
found in numerous countries. Using a 200-foot
Alexanderson alternator, Marconi broadcast radio
transmissions during World War I that were heard
all over Europe.
In 1916, Alexanderson made another important
contribution to radio broadcasting when he unveiled
his tuned radio receiver, which allowed for selective
tuning. It quickly became an integral part of radio
broadcasting.
Alexanderson’s alternator played an important part
in history when President Woodrow Wilson used it
to broadcast his 1918 ultimatum to Germany, ending
the war. Afterwards, the Marconi company sought to
buy exclusive world rights to the alternator, but was
rebuffed by the U.S. government. Wishing to keep
control of the invention within American hands, the
government set up the Radio Corporation of America
(RCA) in 1919, with Alexanderson as its chief head
engineer. Concurrently, Alexanderson continued to
work for General Electric, an association that lasted
forty-six years.
In 1919, he made history with yet another of his
inventions when his multiple-tuned antenna, antistatic
receiver, and magnetic amplifier were used to
transmit the first two-way radio conversation. This
great event took place 900 miles out to sea, between
the Trans-Atlantic Marconi Company station at New
Brunswick and the steamship George Washington,
with President Woodrow Wilson on board as a witness.
The magnetic amplifier was outmoded by another
Alexanderson invention, the electronic modulator,
which used vacuum tubes to help generate high frequency
transmitters of great power. Alexanderson
also helped to create the amplidyne, a direct current
generator. By the use of compensating coils and a
short circuit across two of its brushes, the amplidyne
uses a small power input to precisely control a large
power output. Its system of amplification and control
originally was designed for use in steel mills, but later
hundreds of other applications, including an adaption
to fire antiaircraft guns during World War II.
Alexanderson also held patents for his inventions of
telephone relays, radiant energy guided systems for
aircraft, electric ship propulsion, automatic steering,
motors and power transmission systems, railway
electrification systems, as well as inventions in the
fields of radio and television.
In 1924 Alexanderson began his television
research. By 1927 his group was able to broadcast
mechanical television into the home and in 1930
General Electric gave the first large screen demonstration
of television in a theatre in Schenectady. His
team then transferred to RCA where they helped
develop our modern system of television.
Alexanderson retired from General Electric in
January 1948, although he remained a consultant
engineer to the company. In 1952 Alexanderson was
consulted for RCA. In all, Alexanderson held 322
patents for his inventions.
Ernst Alexanderson’s enormous contribution to
technology was acknowledged more than once.
Some of the honors and awards he received during
his long life are: The Gold Medal of the Institute of
Radio Engineers in 1919, the Order of the Polonia
Restituta in 1924, the John Ericcson Medal in 1928,
the Edison Medal of the American Institute of
Electrical Engineers in 1944, the Cedergren Medal
of the Royal Institute of Technology of Sweden in
1945, and the Valdemar Poulsen Gold Medal
and the Royal Danish Medal, both in 1946. He
received honorary degrees from Union College,
Schenectady, New York in 1926, and the University
of Uppsala in 1938. He was a member, fellow, and
later president of the Institute of Radio Engineers, a
member and president of the Institute of Radio
Engineers, and a member of the Swedish Royal
Academy and Sigma Xi. In his spare time and retirement,
Alexanderson enjoyed sailing, and was elected
the first Commodore of the Lake George Yacht
Club in New York. Alexanderson died at the age of
ninety-seven on May 14, 1975.
