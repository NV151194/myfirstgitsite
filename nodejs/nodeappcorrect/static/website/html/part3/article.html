		<h1>Development</h1>
		<p>Following their success with the Donkey Kong Country games in the mid-1990s, developer Rare built their next Donkey Kong series game upon its predecessors' gameplay but not as a direct sequel.[13] Rare's Gregg Mayles led the effort to create the 3D Donkey Kong.[14] Development began in 1997—immediately after the completion of Donkey Kong Country 3: Dixie Kong's Double Trouble![15]—for release on the Nintendo 64's disk drive add-on.[16][17] It was transitioned for release on the base console after the add-on was delayed and eventually canceled.[18] A team of 16 people worked on the title over the course of three years, and an additional eight members assisted in its later stages.[3][15] Many developers transitioned from Rare's Banjo team, which had worked on Banjo-Kazooie and its sequel.[19] Donkey Kong 64 was built atop the former's game engine.</p>
