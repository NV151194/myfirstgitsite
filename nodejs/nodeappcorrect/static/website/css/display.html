<p>1. The Benedictine priory, which was very small and poor, had a history of troubled relations with its bishop.<span>2. The scandal that came to light in 1517, however, became enough of a cause célèbre to contribute to the priory's eventual suppression in 1525. <span>3. Katherine Wells, the prioress of Littlemore at that time, ran the priory with strict and often violent discipline.<span> 4. She was accused of regularly putting nuns in the stocks for extended periods, as well as physically assaulting them. <span>5. She also had a baby by the priory's chaplain and had pawned the priory's jewels to pay for the child's upbringing. <span>6. She entertained men in her parlour, even after the bishop had been made aware of the accusations, which involved heavy drinking.<span>7. At least one other nun also had a child.<span>8. On one occasion four nuns broke out of the priory through a window and escaped into the surrounding villages for some weeks</span></p>
