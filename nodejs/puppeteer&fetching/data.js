                'There are many ideas about the formation and evolution of the Solar System. The accepted idea is that 4.6 billion years ago, there was a very big cloud of gas in our area of space, known as a nebula. The Nebula eventually became so big that gravity pulled all the gas to the center. Eventually because of all the gas it became so hot there that some hydrogen atoms fused together to make helium. As they did this a lot of energy was let out. All this energy eventually made the Sun. The leftover gas and dust made the planets, their moons, asteroids and all other objects in the Solar System. Scientists think now that solar systems are created out of a huge cloud of gas. The process by which the solar sytems are created is called the Nebular Theory.',

                'The formation of Earth occurred as part of the formation of the Solar System. It started as a large rotating cloud of dust and gas.',
                'This cloud, the solar nebula, was composed of hydrogen and helium produced in the Big Bang, as well as heavier elements produced in supernovas. Then, about 4.68×109 years ago, the solar nebula began to contract, rotate and gain angular momentum.',
                'This may have been triggered by a star in the region exploding as a supernova, and sending a shock wave through the solar nebula.',
                'As the cloud rotated, it became a flat disc perpendicular to its axis of rotation. Most of the mass concentrated in the middle and began to heat up. Meanwhile, the rest of the disc began to break up into rings, with gravity causing matter to condense around dust particles. Small fragments collided to become larger fragments, including one collection about 150 million kilometers from the center: this would become the Earth.',

                'As soon as the oxygen was produced by photosynthesis it was taken out again by reacting with other elements (such as iron).This continued until about 2.1 billion years ago when the concentration of oxygen increased markedly. As oxygen levels built up and then . . . . . . The ozone layer was formed which started to filter out harmful ultraviolet rays. This allowed the evolution of new living organisms in the shallow seas.',
