        paragraph: 'Think neutral colors — black, white, and beige — in luxurious, high quality textures. Polished chrome, steel, and woods with plenty of sheen and shine add to the glamour. Because colors are muted in this sophisticated, tailored style, texture is supreme;therefore, textiles have woven (not printed) patterns.'

        topic: 'Coastal Life.',
        paragraph: 'Blue and white seems so right. This Greek Islands approach adds healthy doses of summer-sky blue to a mostly purewhite background. Adding rustic wooden accents, textured textiles, and glazed and decorated pottery makes this look even warmer.'

        paragraph: 'Ruffles and flourishes in the form of dressmaker details (pleats, ribbon, welting, and other trim) distinguish this feminine and pretty look. Colors run the gamut of pastels, both warm and cool. Floral patterns abound, smaller scaledand less imposing than the English Country House look that’s a ric kissing cousin.'

        paragraph: 'Earthy textures and bright calico patterns found in the fabrics make this look enduringly popular. Colors are strong: mustard, rusty red, indigo, and grass green. Fabrics stand up well against white plaster walls. The same patterns in wall coverings makedefinite style statements for walls.'

        paragraph: 'This faded-glory style paints everything within sight white — antiqued and softened to ivory or linen white — which resonates strongly with lovers of genteel furnishings that appear to have seen better days. Your paint job doesn’t have to be high quality;the more chips, nicks, and dents the better. If your scheme seem color-starved, add discreet accents'

Look to the flowers of spring and summer for a color palette. Simple linens andcottons in solid colors underscore the serenity found in this countryhouse style.'
