          <p>This is quite different from the doggy style position. The
man lies out horizontally over the womanâ€™s body with his
legs apart on outside the legs of the woman. This is a much
more comfortable sex position when compared with
kneeling positions, because it offers both increased intimacy
and a vast range of movement. The woman is lying
underneath his body with a leg folded and supporting her
upper body by bending elbows. Initially, penetration might
go tricky as the woman possesses less ability to move and
provide him full access, but once it started it can go deep,
providing both partners sensible joys and mild experiences.
Beginners might go docking in start to avoid any frustration,
but once started it could go deep inside the vaginal and anal
hole providing intense sex with enthusiastic experiences. Try
to go inside without any hands support. This could entail
your experience and might prove to be a rehearsal for you
to use it in various sex positions. This involves a sense of
comfortability for both partners.</p>
