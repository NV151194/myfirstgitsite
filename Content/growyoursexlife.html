               <p>Heading towards the climax of this book, let's have a look at
                  what has passed on. Starting from the scratch, this is a book

          </div>
          <div>
               <p>Talking about the positions to try out while going dominantly
with your female partner, we find a precise set of positions,
famously known as the man on top sex positions. These
positions involve missionary sex positions, that enthusiasts
both partners to go deep and harsh while giving dominance
to men on their women. This is closer to nature as it
involves naturalistic positions. These positions ensure
deeper penetrations, higher exposures of the bodies, classy
kissing and licking experiences, favoring orgasmic sex and
allowing both partners to indulge in each other's body so
heavily and forever.</p>
</div>
          <div>
               <p>Giving a resemblance to these set of positions, another
chapter is offered with glamorous women on top sex
positions. These are the positions that entail your courage
and kindness for women counterpart, especially during sex.
These positions allow the women to control the penis
inclusion inside her holes. That is why it is one of the most
demanding sex positions across women. Females who love
to go harsh, wild sex while going roughly and making penis
inclusion a bit harder on her, wouldn't love these positions
due to their smooth and gentle approach. These positions
entail a gentle push, a little orgasm and feeling the heat.
These positions are not mostly favored by the male
counterpart as it dictates them to go gentle. While going
through these positions, a man can have joys and fantasies
long-lasting and sensational experiences of sightseeing
while his penis includes inside her vagina or anal hole. The
more she enjoys the sex, the more it will be delightful for
both the partners. Talking about the deflowering of girls or
women experiencing sex for the first time in their life, these
positions would be a reward for them. It lessens their pain
ratio, bleeding ratio and may even lessen the weeping
scenario of the girl. With a slower approach for the first time
in sex for a newcomer girl, sex would be a lot more joyous,
plausible and enthusiastic. She will love you, will never go
towards anyone else except you. She will become a fan of
yours.</p>

               <p>At the next level, a chapter comes with sex from behind
variations. This chapter involves desirously famous doggy
style variations, that allow pelvis access and exposure
together with stronger clitoral stimulation with various
angles and deep penetration. These are full of adventure
and enthusiasm and fill the hearts of the partners with joys

               <p>Moving ahead with recalling, next in queue is kneeling sex
positions chapter. This chapter involves saint variations for
kneeling, pressed guard and other guard variations, and
candle variations. These are mostly less tried positions but
involve stronger intent and approach towards rough sex and
going harsh inside her holes to make her feel every inch of
the penis. Strong rubbing of the penis with inner lips of the
vagina and gaping of the anal hole is the beauties of these
positions. But one thing that is mentionable about these
positions, is their lesser penetrations due to the female
buttocks sizes. More thoroughly or comprehensively you
strike her pelvis, there are more likely chances of going
deep inside her holes. Otherwise, it stands short but joys are
not less than any other group of positions.</p>
</div>
          <div>
