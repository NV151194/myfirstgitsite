          <p>Another enthusiastic position from the family of standing
sex positions is standing crossed candle, also famously
known as tilted candle. In this position, the woman lies down
on the bed with her back and face up towards the man. Man
is standing in front of her body with her folded legs touching
his body and straight up in the air, crossed and rested on his
shoulders. He holds her legs by his hands. In this way, her
body is exposed to his sight. He may try to kiss and lick her
body, may even go for clitoral rubbing by his hands or may
play with her clit. Her holes are pretty much straight angled
respect to his penis, allowing his penis to taste her depths.
Therefore, he tries to go inside without the use of force and
can go deep until the last fraction of his penis touches her
full, providing her enthusiastic experiences with mild joys
and sensational satisfaction.</p>
