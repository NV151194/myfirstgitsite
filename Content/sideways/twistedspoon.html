          <p>Another enthusiastic position from the family of spoon sex
positions is the twisted spoon. This allows the man to lie
sideways and gently push towards the pelvis of the woman,
making her feel special by enjoying every inch of the penis.
The woman lies sideways towards the legs of the man and
forwarding her pelvis towards his penis. This position purely
allows the sensational, harsh rubbing and clitoral
stimulation with extra intents of sightseeing. A gentle push
with the use of force by the man could enthusiasts his lady
to feel special and enjoy the instincts of sex. As she's lying
sideways and providing access to both the holes to his man,
this allows her to feel more out of sex. On the other hand
the man, with hands-on her hips or back, pushes her
forward to ingest his full and getting her to feel his penis
with deep penetration and strong stimulation. This position
may get a little discomfort for both but guarantees higher
satisfaction by enjoying the heat of the moment.</p>
