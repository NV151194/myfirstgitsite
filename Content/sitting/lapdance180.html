          <p>The lap dance 180 is quite similar to lap dance position and
the only difference is the spinning of the woman towards the
man, lying on her lap with face-to-face exposure. The more
she comes near her man, the more joy it will be for both the
partners. This position allows her to put her arms around his
neck. indulging him to suck her boobs and kiss her
everywhere on upper parts of the body while the man,
having his arms on her buttocks, pushes her forward to
make deep penetration possible. The man sits on a chair
and relaxes by going deep inside her holes. Both holes are
easily accessible with the option of going curvy inside the
anal hole. The vaginal hole may not encounter enough
rubbing as the vagina is right above the penis and allows
frictionless inclusion. The woman with widened legs may
suffer discomfort and less mobility. But this could be solved
by using a sturdy chair to avoid accidents. Being on face-toface
with the partner could enthusiast the mildness and
drive both partners into the craziness.</p>
