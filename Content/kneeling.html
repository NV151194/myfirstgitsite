     		<p>Many couples prefer to have sex on their knees as it is
comfortable as well as enthusiastic. In these positions, both
the partners lie closer with one or both on the knees,
allowing enough room for the other to settle down and enjoy
the exposure of the bodily parts. These positions allow both
partners to set the pace of sexual intercourse, controlling
the deepness of the penetration. If you want the real
enjoyment with the touch of sensation, you must try these
positions with your partners to get out of the box enjoyment
and satisfaction from sex. Key conditions for good sex is the
ability to get more out of it and try and experimenting the
most daring fantasies to explore and expose the holes of
your female partner and satisfy her with your full. Being a
ruler in sex demands nothing more than just passion and
deliverance.</p>
